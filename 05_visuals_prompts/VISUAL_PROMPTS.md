# AI Visual Generation Prompts for CC21TE Work Instructions

**Objective:** To create clear, photorealistic, and technically accurate visual aids for the production team to supplement the written Work Instructions (WIs). The style should be clean, modern, and easy to understand, focusing on the specific details of the assembly process.

## Shot List & Prompts

### 1. Floor System Assembly (for WI-101)

#### 1.1 Exploded View of Floor Assembly
-   **Shot:** Exploded axonometric view of the entire floor assembly.
-   **Prompt:** "Create a photorealistic, exploded axonometric view of a modular home floor system, 44 feet 10 inches long by 12 feet 5 inches wide. Show the following layers, from bottom to top, with vertical separation: 1) LSL rim board frame, 2) 11-7/8 inch deep engineered I-joists at 16 inches on-center with BC-T1 joist hangers, 3) 3/4 inch T&G OSB subfloor sheathing. The style should be a clean, technical illustration with a white background, similar to a high-end architectural product manual. Label each major component clearly."

#### 1.2 Fastener Map: Subfloor Nailing
-   **Shot:** Top-down view of a single sheet of OSB subfloor, showing the nailing pattern.
-   **Prompt:** "Generate a top-down, 2D technical illustration of a 4x8 sheet of OSB subfloor being installed over engineered I-joists. Clearly show the required fastening pattern with red dots for nails: 8 inches on-center along the edges and 12 inches on-center in the field. Label the spacing dimensions. Include a callout showing a bead of construction adhesive on the top of the joist. The style should be a simple, clear diagram with a white background."

#### 1.3 Good vs. Bad: Joist Hanger Installation
-   **Shot:** Two side-by-side images showing correct and incorrect joist hanger installation.
-   **Prompt:** "Create a "Good vs. Bad" comparison image for installing a BC-T1 joist hanger. 
    -   **Good:** A photorealistic image of a joist hanger installed correctly, with all nail holes filled with 10d x 1-1/2" nails, the joist seated flush, and no gaps. Label it "CORRECT: All holes filled, no gaps."
    -   **Bad:** A photorealistic image of the same joist hanger with missing nails, nails driven at an angle, and a gap between the joist and the hanger. Label it "INCORRECT: Missing nails, gaps present." Use clear green checkmarks and red X marks to indicate good and bad examples."

### 2. Wall System Assembly (for WI-201)

#### 2.1 Exploded View of SIPS Wall
-   **Shot:** Exploded view of a single SIPS panel with a window opening.
-   **Prompt:** "Create a photorealistic, exploded view of a 6-3/8 inch Structural Insulated Panel (SIPS) for an exterior wall. Show the layers: 1) outer 7/16" OSB sheathing, 2) 5-1/2" EPS foam core, 3) inner 7/16" OSB sheathing. Show a window rough opening framed with 2x6 lumber within the panel. Include a 2x6 lumber spline ready to be inserted into the side of the panel. The style should be a clean, technical illustration on a white background."

#### 2.2 Fastener Map: Shear Wall Nailing
-   **Shot:** Front view of a W1 interior shear wall, highlighting the nailing pattern.
-   **Prompt:** "Generate a 2D technical diagram of a wood-framed shear wall (W1). The wall is framed with 2x4 studs at 16 inches on-center and has (3) 2x4 studs at each end. Show the 7/16" OSB sheathing on the front. Use red dots to illustrate the nailing pattern: 4 inches on-center around the entire perimeter and 12 inches on-center in the field. Label the spacing dimensions clearly. Use a clean, black-and-white line drawing style."

#### 2.3 Good vs. Bad: Wall Plumbness
-   **Shot:** Two images showing a wall being checked for plumb.
-   **Prompt:** "Create a "Good vs. Bad" comparison for checking wall plumbness. 
    -   **Good:** A photorealistic image of a 6-foot level held vertically against a wall, with the bubble perfectly centered. A green checkmark is next to it. Label it "CORRECT: Wall is plumb."
    -   **Bad:** A photorealistic image of the same level on a wall, with the bubble clearly off-center. A red X is next to it. Label it "INCORRECT: Wall is not plumb." The background should be a construction site."

### 3. Roof System Assembly (for WI-301)

#### 3.1 Exploded View of Roof Assembly
-   **Shot:** Exploded axonometric view of the entire roof assembly.
-   **Prompt:** "Create a photorealistic, exploded axonometric view of a modular home roof system. Show the following layers from bottom to top: 1) Assembled wood-framed walls, 2) Triple 1-3/4" x 14" LVL ridge beam supported on temporary posts, 3) SIPS roof panels being lowered into place by a crane, 4) Simpson H3.5 hangers connecting the SIPS panels to the ridge beam. The style should be a dynamic, high-end architectural illustration showing the process of assembly. The background should be a clean sky."

#### 3.2 Detail Callout: Ridge Beam to SIPS Connection
-   **Shot:** Close-up, detailed view of the connection between a SIPS roof panel and the LVL ridge beam.
-   **Prompt:** "Generate a photorealistic, detailed close-up view of a SIPS roof panel connecting to a triple LVL ridge beam. Show two Simpson H3.5 hangers, one on each side of the ridge beam, fastened to the SIPS panel and the beam. Clearly show all required nails in the hangers. Label the components: "SIPS Roof Panel", "Triple LVL Ridge Beam", and "Simpson H3.5 Hanger". The lighting should be bright and clear to highlight the connection details."

#### 3.3 Good vs. Bad: Crane Rigging for SIPS Panels
-   **Shot:** Two images showing correct and incorrect rigging of a SIPS panel for a crane lift.
-   **Prompt:** "Create a "Good vs. Bad" safety comparison for rigging a SIPS roof panel for a crane lift. 
    -   **Good:** A photorealistic image showing a SIPS panel being lifted with a spreader bar and multiple, evenly spaced straps, ensuring the panel is balanced and stable. Label it "CORRECT: Use spreader bar, balanced load."
    -   **Bad:** A photorealistic image showing a SIPS panel being lifted from a single point in the center, causing the panel to be unstable and bend. Label it "INCORRECT: Unstable, single-point lift." Use clear safety-oriented graphics (green checkmark, red X)."
