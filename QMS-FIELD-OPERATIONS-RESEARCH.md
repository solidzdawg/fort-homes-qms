## 1. REGULATORY FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS

### 1.1 HUD Code (24 CFR Part 3280 & 3282) - Key Field Implications

**Critical HUD Requirements for Field Operations:**

#### Manufacturing vs. Installation Responsibility Split
- **Factory Responsibility (Manufacturer):** Complete all construction possible before shipment
- **Field Responsibility (Installer/Developer):** Complete approved on-site work per HUD Subpart M
- **Shared Responsibility:** Quality assurance, inspection, and certification at all stages

**Key HUD Sections Affecting Field QMS:**

| CFR Section | Focus | Field QMS Impact |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 24 CFR 3280.5 | Data Plate Requirements | Field teams must maintain/validate data plate info |
| 24 CFR 3280.305(h)(5) | Roof/Structural On-Site Work | Requires approved installation instructions |
| 24 CFR 3280.603-612 | Plumbing Systems | On-site connections must follow manufacturer specs |
| 24 CFR 3280.705 | Gas Piping | Field connections require certification |
| 24 CFR 3280.803-813 | Electrical Systems | Final field hookups need inspection/testing |
| 24 CFR 3282.601-609 | **On-Site Completion** | **MOST CRITICAL FOR FIELD QMS** |
| 24 CFR 3282.303 | State Administrative Standards | Installation monitoring required by SAAs |

**HUD Subpart M (On-Site Completion) - Foundation for FHD QMS:**

The most critical regulatory framework allows for approved on-site completion when:
1. Home substantially completed at factory
2. On-site work must bring home into full compliance
3. Manufacturer retains responsibility for all on-site work quality
4. IPIA inspection required before occupancy
5. Detailed site inspection reports and certification mandatory

**Allowed On-Site Construction Activities:**
- Hinged roof and eave assembly
- Structural connections between modules

## 3. CRITICAL FHD FIELD QMS DESIGN PRINCIPLES

### 3.1 Regulatory Compliance Framework

**Non-Negotiable Requirements:**
1. **Manufacturer Responsibility** - FHD retains liability for all on-site work per HUD regulations
2. **IPIA Coordination** - All on-site completion work must be approved by Design Approval Primary Inspection Agency (DAPIA)
3. **Certified Professionals** - Licensed trades required for utility connections (electrician, plumber, gas technician)
4. **Documentation Trail** - Complete records of all on-site inspections and certifications per 24 CFR 3282.605
5. **Final Inspection** - IPIA on-site inspection required before occupancy (24 CFR 3282.605(c))

### 3.2 Quality Management System Architecture

**Hybrid Factory-Field Model:**
```
Factory QMS (Fort and Homes LLC)
├── Design approval (DAPIA)
├── Manufacturing SOPs
├── Production inspection
└── Factory certification → Module shipped to site

        ↓ (Module delivery)

Field QMS (Fort and Homes Development/FHD)
├── Site QMS (foundation, utilities, finishing)
├── Field Assembly SOPs
├── On-site inspection procedures
├── Licensed trades coordination
└── Final IPIA inspection & certification → Home ready for occupancy
```

**Key Principle:** Field QMS is extension of factory QMS, not replacement

### 3.3 Accountability and Authority

- **Factory:** Responsible for module quality and completeness
- **FHD Field Operations:** Responsible for site preparation, utility connections, final assembly, and site finishing
- **Third-Party Licensed Trades:** Responsible for licensed work (electrical, plumbing, gas)
- **IPIA:** Independent verification that field work meets HUD standards
- **SAA (Colorado):** State oversight and complaint handling

## 5. SHARED DOCUMENTATION STRATEGY

### 5.1 Dual-Repository Structure (Hybrid Approach Confirmed)

**Fort and Homes LLC Repository (Primary):**
- All 28 factory SOPs (SOP-001-020, SOP-101-108)
- Factory-specific procedures (manufacturing, quality)
- 8 production phases and associated work instructions
- Design approval documentation

**Fort and Homes Development Repository (New):**
- 7-8 field operation SOPs (FHD-OP-001-008)
- 7 field installation SOPs (FI-001-007)
- 7 field work instructions (WI-FI-001-007)
- 7 field inspection forms (FORM-FI-001-007)
- FHD Quality Manual (field-specific)
- Customer handoff procedures

**Shared/Adapted Documentation:**
When FHD-specific SOPs reference factory SOPs, they include:
- **Adaptation Points:** Where field context differs
- **Reference Links:** Cross-references to factory procedures
- **Compliance Notes:** How field version maintains HUD/regulatory compliance

### 5.2 Adaptation Principle Example

**Example: SOP-001 Document Control**
- **Factory Version (SOP-001):** Controls manufacturing documents, BOMs, drawings
- **Field Version (FHD-OP-001):** Controls field installation instructions, checklists, site-specific adaptations
- **Shared Principle:** Both use document version control, approval workflows, distribution tracking
- **FHD-OP-001 References:** "See SOP-001 for document control principles; this SOP applies those principles to field installation documents"
