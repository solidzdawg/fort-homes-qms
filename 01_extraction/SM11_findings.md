# SM11 Ceiling and Roof Framing Plans - Key Findings

## Ceiling Framing Plan

### Ceiling Joists
- **Joist Type:** SIPS (Structural Insulated Panels) between Grid 1 & 2
- **Joist Configuration:** 
  - (3) LVL 1-3/4" x 14" (triple LVL beam) at Grid 2
  - (3) LVL 1-3/4" x 11-7/8" (triple LVL beam) at other locations
  - Framing around ceiling opening for stairs

### Ceiling Joist Callouts
- NO BEAM SPLICES BETWEEN GRID 1 & 2 (multiple locations)
- NO BEAM SPLICES BETWEEN GRID 2 & 3 (multiple locations)
- SIPS @ CEILING BETWEEN GRID 1 & 2
- SIPS @ CEILING BETWEEN GRID 2 & 3

## Roof Framing Plan

### Ridge Beam
- **Ridge Beam:** (3) 1-3/4" x 14" LVL (triple LVL beam)
- **Ridge Length:** Runs full length of building (44'-10")

### Roof Rafters/SIPS
- **Rafter Type:** SIPS (Structural Insulated Panels) for roof
- **Rafter Configuration:**
  - SIPS @ ROOF BETWEEN GRID 1 & 2
  - SIPS @ ROOF BETWEEN GRID 2 & 3
  - SIPS @ ROOF BETWEEN GRID 3 & 4
  - (2) SIMPSON H3.5 @ 16" O.C. MAX @ RIDGE BEAM BEARING SURFACE
  - (2) SIMPSON H3.5 @ 16" O.C. MAX @ GABLE WALL BEARING SURFACE

### Gable & Ridge Beam Diagram (Right Side)
- Shows gable end framing with vertical studs
- Ridge beam at peak: 1-3/4" x 14" LVL
- Dimensions shown: 15'-11 1/2" (ridge height from SM30)

### Grid 3 Beam Diagram
- Shows beam configuration at Grid 3
- Vertical members at regular spacing

## Roof Framing Note
**NOTE:** THE ROOF PLAN HAS BEEN DESIGNED FOR THE ADDITIONAL STEP ROOF CAVITY PER SOLAR REQUIREMENT. THE ADDITIONAL STEP IS DESIGNED TO BE ON THE SAME ROOF SURFACE.

## Schedules (Same as SM10)
- Header Schedule (H0, H1, H2)
- Wall Schedule (S1, S2, W1)
- Wood I-Joist Strapping Schedule (14C1, 14C2)
