## 5. Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Wall Plate Layout

**What:** Mark the locations of all interior and exterior walls on the completed floor deck.

**How:**
1.  Using the chalk line, transfer the wall locations from the **AM10 Floor Plan** onto the subfloor.
2.  Double-check all dimensions, including room sizes and opening locations.
3.  Mark the locations for all hold-down anchors and straps as specified on the **SM10 Wall Framing Plan**.

**Verify:**
-   All wall locations match the plans to within +/- 1/8".
-   All opening locations are correctly marked.

### Step 2: Assemble Interior Walls

**What:** Frame the interior non-load-bearing and shear walls.

**How:**
1.  Cut **2x4 SPF #2** top and bottom plates to length for each interior wall.
2.  Lay out stud locations on the plates at **16" O.C.**
3.  Assemble the walls on the assembly table, fastening studs to plates with **16d common nails**.
4.  For **W1 shear walls**, install **7/16" OSB sheathing** on one side. Fasten with **0.131" Ø nails** at **4" O.C. on edges** and **12" O.C. in the field**.
    -   **Source:** SM10, Wall Schedule W1
5.  Frame all rough openings for interior doors as per the **AM10 Door Schedule**.

**Verify:**
-   Stud spacing is correct.
-   Shear wall nailing pattern is correct.
-   Walls are square and dimensions are accurate.

### Step 3: Assemble and Install Exterior SIPS Walls

**What:** Prepare and install the Structural Insulated Panels for the exterior walls.

**How:**
1.  Cut window and door openings into the **6-3/8" SIPS panels** as per the **AM10 Floor Plan** and **Window/Door Schedules**.
2.  Install **lumber splines (2x6 SPF #2)** at all panel joints as specified on SM10.
3.  Install headers (**H0, H1, H2**) as per the **SM10 Header Schedule** and details on **SM40**.
4.  Carefully lift each SIPS wall panel into position on the floor deck.
5.  Fasten the SIPS panels to the floor system and to each other according to the manufacturer's instructions and SM40 details.

**Verify:**
-   All openings are in the correct locations and sized correctly.
-   Splines are installed at all panel joints.
-   Panels are plumb and straight.

### Step 4: Set Interior Walls and Tie-In

**What:** Lift the completed interior walls into place and secure them.

**How:**
1.  Lift the interior walls into their marked locations.
2.  Plumb and brace each wall temporarily.
3.  Fasten the bottom plates to the floor joists below using **16d common nails**.
4.  Nail intersecting walls together.
5.  Install the double top plate, overlapping at corners and intersections to tie the wall system together.

**Verify:**
-   All walls are plumb (+/- 1/8" over 8").
-   All walls are securely fastened to the floor and to each other.
