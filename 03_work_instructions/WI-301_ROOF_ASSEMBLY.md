## 5. Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Install Ceiling Beams

**What:** Install the built-up LVL ceiling beams.

**How:**
1.  Assemble the triple LVL ceiling beams on the ground as per the **SM11 Ceiling Framing Plan**.
2.  Using the crane, carefully lift and set the ceiling beams into position on top of the walls.
    -   **Grid 2 Beam:** (3) 1-3/4" x 14" LVL
    -   **Other Beams:** (3) 1-3/4" x 11-7/8" LVL
3.  Ensure beams are aligned with grid lines as shown on the plan.
4.  Temporarily brace the beams.

**Verify:**
-   Beams are located correctly on the grid lines.
-   Beams are level and straight.

### Step 2: Install Ridge Beam

**What:** Set the main structural ridge beam.

**How:**
1.  Assemble the **(3) 1-3/4" x 14" LVL ridge beam** on the ground.
2.  Using the crane, lift the ridge beam to its final elevation (**15’-11 1/2"** from finished floor).
    -   **Source:** SM30, Building Sections
3.  Set the ridge beam on temporary supports or gable end framing.
4.  Plumb and brace the ridge beam securely.

**Verify:**
-   Ridge beam is at the correct elevation.
-   Ridge beam is plumb and centered on the building.

### Step 3: Install Roof SIPS Panels

**What:** Install the structural insulated panels for the roof.

**How:**
1.  Begin panel installation from one end of the building.
2.  Apply sealant to all panel joints as per the manufacturer’s requirements.
3.  Using the crane and SIPS panel lift, fly each roof panel into position.
4.  Set the panels on the top plates of the walls and against the ridge beam.
5.  Install **Simpson H3.5 hangers** to connect the SIPS panels to the ridge beam and gable walls at **16" O.C. max**.
    -   **Source:** SM11, Roof Framing Plan
6.  Fasten the panels to the top plates and to each other using the fasteners specified by the SIPS manufacturer.
7.  Install **BC-T2 and BC-L connectors** as per details on **SM41**.

**Verify:**
-   All panel joints are sealed.
-   All required hardware (H3.5, BC-T2, BC-L) is installed correctly.
-   Roof plane is flat and straight.
