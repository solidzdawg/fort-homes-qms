## 5. Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Layout and Rim Board Installation

**What:** Establish the perimeter of the floor frame and install the rim boards.

**How:**
1.  Using the chalk line, mark the overall dimensions of the floor frame on the assembly table: **44’-10" x 12’-5"**.
    -   **Source:** SM10, Floor Framing Plan
2.  Verify the layout is square by measuring diagonals. The measurements must be equal.
3.  Cut two sections of **1-1/2" x 11-7/8" LSL** to **44’-10"** for the long rim boards.
4.  Cut two sections of **1-1/2" x 11-7/8" LSL** to **12’-5" minus 3"** (for the thickness of the long rim boards) for the short rim boards.
5.  Assemble the four rim boards into a rectangular frame. Fasten the corners using **16d common nails**.

**Verify:**
-   Frame dimensions are correct to within +/- 1/8".
-   Frame is square.

### Step 2: Joist Layout and Installation

**What:** Mark joist locations and install the engineered I-joists.

**How:**
1.  On the inside of the long rim boards, mark the joist locations starting from one end.
    -   **Specification:** **16" O.C.** spacing.
    -   **Source:** SM10, Floor Framing Plan
2.  Install **BC-T1 joist hangers** at each marked location on the rim board. Fasten with **10d x 1-1/2" joist hanger nails** into every hole.
    -   **Source:** SM40, Detail 1, 2, 3
3.  Cut the **11-7/8" I-joists** to length (**12’-5" minus 3"**).
4.  Place each joist into its hanger, ensuring it is flush with the top of the rim board.
5.  Fasten the joists to the hangers using **10d x 1-1/2" joist hanger nails**.

**Verify:**
-   Joist spacing is **16" O.C. (+/- 1/4")**.
-   All joists are flush with the top of the rim boards.
-   All joist hanger nail holes are filled.

### Step 3: Subfloor Sheathing Installation

**What:** Install the tongue-and-groove subfloor sheathing.

**How:**
1.  Apply a continuous bead of **PL Premium construction adhesive** to the top of each joist.
2.  Lay the first row of **3/4" T&G OSB** sheathing perpendicular to the joists.
3.  Fasten the sheathing using **8d ring shank nails**.
    -   **Fastening Pattern (Edges):** **8" O.C.** along all panel edges.
    -   **Fastening Pattern (Field):** **12" O.C.** in the field (over intermediate joists).
    -   **Source:** To be extracted from SM10 details.
4.  Continue laying sheathing, ensuring T&G joints are fully engaged and staggering the panel seams between rows.

**Verify:**
-   Adhesive is applied to all joists.
-   Fastening pattern is correct.
-   No gaps between sheathing panels.

## 6. Quality Checkpoints

| Checkpoint | Requirement | Method | Acceptance |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Floor Dimensions | 44’-10" x 12’-5" | Tape Measure | +/- 1/8" |
| Squareness | Diagonals are equal | Tape Measure | +/- 1/4" difference |
| Joist Spacing | 16" O.C. | Tape Measure | 15.75" - 16.25" |
| Subfloor Fastening | 8" edges, 12" field | Visual & Tape Measure | Correct spacing, no missed nails |

## 7. Common Mistakes to Avoid

<details>
<summary><strong>⚠️ Common Errors and Prevention</strong></summary>

**Mistake 1:** Floor frame out of square.
-   **Why it happens:** Uneven layout or assembly surface.
-   **How to prevent:** Always measure diagonals before fastening.
-   **If it occurs:** Adjust the frame with a sledgehammer and block before proceeding.

**Mistake 2:** Incorrect joist spacing.
-   **Why it happens:** Cumulative error in layout.
-   **How to prevent:** Mark all joist locations from the same end.
-   **If it occurs:** Re-install misplaced joists before sheathing.
