## 1. Purpose

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) defines the process for the fabrication, assembly, and inspection of the exterior and interior wall systems for the CC21TE modular home project. This procedure ensures all wall assemblies are built to the specifications of the engineered plans, meet quality standards, and comply with building codes.

**Note:** Fort Homes builds modular homes (IRC-compliant, permanent foundation) per 8 CCR 1302-14, NOT manufactured homes (HUD Code).

---

## 2. Scope

**PHASE-2** production station (Bay 2)

This procedure applies to:
-   Assembly of interior wood-framed walls and shear walls.
-   Fabrication and installation of exterior Structural Insulated Panel (SIPS) walls.
-   Installation of headers, rough openings, and associated hardware.

**Duration:** 2-3 days per bay
**Hold Point:** **HP-2** (Third-party inspection not required)

## 6. Procedure

### 6.1 Pre-Work Preparation
1.  The Bay Supervisor shall confirm that HP-1 has been signed off and the floor assembly is ready.
2.  All materials for the wall system (BOM Section 2.0) must be staged and inspected.
3.  The Framing Crew shall review WI-201 and the relevant shop drawings (SM10, AM10).

### 6.2 Wall Assembly
1.  The Framing Crew shall execute the wall assembly following the detailed steps in **WI-201: Wall System Assembly**.
2.  Key specifications to be strictly followed:
    -   Wall Locations: Per **AM10 Floor Plan**.
    -   Shear Wall Nailing: **4" O.C. edges, 12" O.C. field**.
    -   SIPS Installation: Per manufacturer instructions and **SM40** details.
3.  All walls must be plumb, straight, and securely braced before proceeding.

### 6.3 Quality Verification
1.  The Framing Crew is responsible for in-process quality checks as defined in WI-201 (wall plumbness, opening sizes, fastening).
2.  The Bay Supervisor shall conduct a final review before the HP-2 inspection.

### 6.4 Documentation
1.  The Framing Crew and Bay Supervisor shall sign off on the completed tasks in the Module Traveler.

## 7. Hold Point Inspection (HP-2)

**Trigger:** Completion of all steps in WI-201.

**Inspector:** QA Inspector

**Inspection Criteria:** See **FORM-I-201: Wall System Inspection Checklist**

**Pass Criteria:**
-   All items on FORM-I-201 are marked "Pass".
-   No open NCRs related to the wall system.

**Fail Response:** Initiate NCR per SOP-004. The assembly cannot move to the next station until the NCR is resolved and the inspection is passed.

## 8. Safety & Environmental

### Safety Considerations
-   Fall protection is mandatory when working on scaffolding or setting walls.
-   Follow proper lifting procedures for heavy walls and panels.
-   Ensure temporary bracing is secure at all times.

### Environmental Controls
-   Minimize SIPS foam waste by optimizing cuts.
-   Dispose of wood and SIPS scraps in designated recycling bins.
