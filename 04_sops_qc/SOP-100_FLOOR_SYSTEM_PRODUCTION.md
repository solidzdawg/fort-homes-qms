## 1. Purpose

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) defines the process for the fabrication and inspection of the floor system for the CC21TE modular home project. The purpose is to ensure that all floor assemblies are built to the precise specifications of the engineered plans, meet all quality standards, and comply with applicable building codes.

**Note:** Fort Homes builds modular homes (IRC-compliant, permanent foundation) per 8 CCR 1302-14, NOT manufactured homes (HUD Code).

## 2. Scope

**PHASE-1** production station (Bay 1)

This procedure applies to:
-   Layout and assembly of the floor frame.
-   Installation of engineered I-joists.
-   Installation of subfloor sheathing.
-   Installation of all associated hardware and fasteners.

**Duration:** 1-2 days per bay
**Hold Point:** **HP-1** (Third-party inspection not required)

2.  Key specifications to be strictly followed:
    -   Overall Dimensions: **44’-10" x 12’-5"**
    -   Joist Spacing: **16" O.C.**
    -   Subfloor Fastening: **8" O.C. edges, 12" O.C. field**
3.  All work must be performed in the sequence outlined in the work instruction.

### 6.3 Quality Verification
1.  The Framing Crew is responsible for in-process quality checks as defined in WI-101.
2.  The Bay Supervisor shall perform a final review of the assembly before calling for the formal hold point inspection.

### 6.4 Documentation
1.  The Framing Crew shall sign off on the completed tasks in the Module Traveler.
2.  The Bay Supervisor shall confirm the completion of the floor assembly phase in the Module Traveler.

## 7. Hold Point Inspection (HP-1)

**Trigger:** Completion of all steps in WI-101.

**Inspector:** QA Inspector

**Inspection Criteria:** See **FORM-I-101: Floor System Inspection Checklist**

**Pass Criteria:**
-   All items on FORM-I-101 are marked "Pass".
-   No open NCRs related to the floor system.

**Fail Response:** Initiate NCR per SOP-004. The assembly cannot move to the next station until the NCR is resolved and the inspection is passed.
