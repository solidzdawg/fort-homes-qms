## 1. Purpose

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) defines the process for the fabrication, assembly, and inspection of the roof system for the CC21TE modular home project. This procedure ensures the roof structure is built to the specifications of the engineered plans, meets all quality standards, and complies with building codes, providing a safe and weather-tight enclosure.

**Note:** Fort Homes builds modular homes (IRC-compliant, permanent foundation) per 8 CCR 1302-14, NOT manufactured homes (HUD Code).

## 2. Scope

**PHASE-3** production station (Bay 3)

This procedure applies to:
-   Assembly and installation of ceiling and ridge beams.
-   Installation of SIPS roof panels.
-   Installation of all structural hardware and connectors.
-   Preparation for roof dry-in.

**Duration:** 2-3 days per bay
**Hold Point:** **HP-3** (Third-party inspection may be required, TBD)

## 6. Procedure

### 6.1 Pre-Work Preparation
1.  The Bay Supervisor shall confirm that HP-2 has been signed off and the wall system is ready and fully braced.
2.  A pre-lift safety meeting must be conducted with the crane operator and framing crew.
3.  All materials for the roof system (BOM Section 3.0) must be staged and inspected.
4.  The Framing Crew shall review WI-301 and the relevant shop drawings (SM11, SM41).

### 6.2 Roof Assembly
1.  The Framing Crew shall execute the roof assembly following the detailed steps in **WI-301: Roof System Assembly**.
2.  Key specifications to be strictly followed:
    -   Ridge Beam: **(3) 1-3/4" x 14" LVL**
    -   Ridge Beam Elevation: **15’-11 1/2"** from finished floor
    -   Hardware: **H3.5 hangers @ 16" O.C. max**
3.  Crane lifts must be directed by a single designated signal person.

### 6.3 Quality Verification
1.  The Framing Crew is responsible for in-process quality checks as defined in WI-301 (beam locations, elevations, hardware installation).
2.  The Bay Supervisor shall conduct a final review of the entire roof structure before the HP-3 inspection.

### 6.4 Documentation
1.  The Framing Crew and Bay Supervisor shall sign off on the completed tasks in the Module Traveler.

## 7. Hold Point Inspection (HP-3)

**Trigger:** Completion of all steps in WI-301.

**Inspector:** QA Inspector / TPIA (if required)

**Inspection Criteria:** See **FORM-I-301: Roof System Inspection Checklist**

**Pass Criteria:**
-   All items on FORM-I-301 are marked "Pass".
-   No open NCRs related to the roof system.

**Fail Response:** Initiate NCR per SOP-004. The assembly cannot proceed to dry-in until the NCR is resolved and the inspection is passed.

## 8. Safety & Environmental

### Safety Considerations
-   **FALL PROTECTION IS MANDATORY** for all personnel working at height.
-   Adhere to all crane safety protocols, including maintaining clear drop zones.
-   Do not perform roof work in high winds, rain, or other adverse weather conditions.

### Environmental Controls
-   Minimize SIPS foam waste.
-   Recycle all wood and SIPS scrap material.
