## 2. Scope

This procedure applies to:
- Eight hold point inspection gates (HP-1 through HP-8)
- Module production phases and phase transitions
- Hold point inspection scheduling and tracking
- Gate approval authority and sign-off requirements
- Non-conforming module disposition

**Applies to:** Quality Inspectors, Production Supervisors, Module Production Team, Quality Manager

## 5. Hold Point Gate Structure (HP-1 through HP-8)

### 5.1 Gate Definitions
- **HP-1:** Material receipt and floor deck preparation verification
- **HP-2:** Floor deck assembly and fastener inspection
- **HP-3:** Wall framing and structural alignment completion
- **HP-4:** Electrical rough-in and system integration readiness
- **HP-5:** Plumbing rough-in and HVAC system readiness
- **HP-6:** Insulation and weatherproofing verification
- **HP-7:** Interior finishing and appliance installation
- **HP-8:** Final quality inspection and module sign-off

### 5.2 Inspection Timing
- Quality Inspector notified minimum 24 hours before scheduled inspection
- Module positioned in designated inspection area
- All required documentation ready for review
- Inspection conducted during shift with supervisor present

## 6. Gate Approval Authority

| Gate | Inspector Authority | Supervisor Authority | Manager Authority |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| HP-1 to HP-7 | Recommend | Approve (minor) | Approve (major) |
| HP-8 Final | Recommend | Review | Approve |

## 7. Non-Conformance & Gate Holds

Modules failing inspection are documented on Hold Point Report. Production Supervisor corrects defects and reschedules inspection. Repeated failures trigger root cause investigation (SOP-004). Gate sign-off recorded on module traveler.
