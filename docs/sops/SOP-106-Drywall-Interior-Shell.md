## 7. Detailed Procedure

### 7.1 Drywall Installation

#### Step 1: Layout & Prepare for Hanging
1. Review engineered plans for:
   - Drywall type (standard or fire-rated)
   - Orientation (horizontal or vertical installation preferred)
   - Fire-rating requirements (if any walls are exterior or between units)
2. Mark stud locations on floor and ceiling (chalk line or tape) for reference
3. Identify any offset wall corners or angles that require special cuts
4. Calculate sheet quantity and plan layout to minimize waste and avoid isolated narrow strips

#### Step 2: Install Drywall Sheets (Walls)
1. **Start at one corner; proceed systematically:**
   - Position first sheet at ceiling line (slightly tight fit to hold it in place)
   - Use drywall hoist to lift ceiling sheet first (reduces propping time)
   - Press sheet firmly against framing; drive fasteners into studs/blocking

2. **Fastener pattern:**
   - **Stud spacing:** 16" o.c. — screws @ 12" o.c. along studs; 16" o.c. in field
   - **Stud spacing:** 24" o.c. — screws @ 12" o.c. along studs; 12" o.c. in field
   - **Edges:** Fasteners 12" o.c. at perimeter; ⅝" minimum from edge (avoid splitting tape)
   - **Fastener depth:** Screws driven to ⅛" dimple (power drill with depth-limiting clutch prevents over-driving)

3. **Verify alignment & flatness:**
   - No visible gaps at seams or corners
   - Sheets flush with adjacent sheets (no high spots or lips)
   - Use straightedge to check; maximum deviation ⅛" over 10 feet

4. **Cut openings for:**
   - Electrical outlets, switches, conduit
   - HVAC returns and ductwork
   - Plumbing vents and drain lines
   - Any architectural features (niches, recesses)

#### Step 3: Install Drywall Sheets (Ceilings)
1. **Install ceiling drywall perpendicular to joists (if possible):**
   - Use hydraulic or manual drywall lift to hold sheets in position
   - One person operates lift; second person secures fasteners
2. **Fastener pattern:**
   - **Joist spacing 16" o.c.:** Screws @ 12" o.c. along joists; 12" o.c. in field
   - **Joist spacing 24" o.c.:** Screws @ 12" o.c. along joists; 12" o.c. in field (or thicker drywall if code allows)
   - **Fastener depth:** ⅛" dimple (avoid crushing ceiling)
3. **Verify flatness:**
   - Sight along ceiling for obvious dips or humps
   - Use straightedge at multiple locations
   - Maximum sag in ceiling: ⅛–¼" (acceptable per code; compensated by finishing)

#### Step 4: Verify Installation Quality
- [ ] All sheets secured with fasteners (no loose edges)
- [ ] No visible gaps or cracks at seams or corners
- [ ] Sheets flush with adjacent sheets (no lips or offsets >1/16")
- [ ] All fasteners dimpled, not over-driven or stripped
- [ ] No fastener "shiners" (missed studs or joists)

### 7.2 Joint Finishing (Tape & Compound)

#### Step 5: Apply Fiberglass Mesh Tape (First Coat Foundation)
1. **Prepare joints:**
   - Vacuum or blow out dust and debris from all joints
   - Lightly sponge (with damp, not wet sponge) to pre-dampen if very dusty
2. **Apply self-adhesive fiberglass mesh:**
   - Center mesh tape over joint seams (2⅛" width straddles ⅛" gap typical)
   - Press tape firmly with hand, ensuring good contact with drywall
   - For corner bead: Cut corner bead to length; apply to all inside and outside corners
   - Nail or screw corner bead per manufacturer (typically 12" o.c.)
3. **Verify tape adhesion:**
   - No wrinkles, bubbles, or loose edges
   - Tape centered on seam; equal coverage on both sides

#### Step 6: First Coat (Foundation Coat)
1. **Mix joint compound per manufacturer instructions:**
   - All-purpose mix: Thin to consistency of peanut butter (not runny, not thick)
   - Stir thoroughly; allow to sit 5 minutes; stir again
2. **Apply first coat:**
   - Use 6" or 10" taping knife
   - Force compound firmly into joint to fill voids behind tape
   - Feather compound 6–8" on each side of joint (creates gradual taper)
   - Remove excess with downward pass of knife (angle ~45°, trailing edge lifting slightly)
3. **Cover all joints, cracks, and fastener heads:**
   - Each screw/nail dimple receives 3 passes (center coat, then feather each side)
   - Ensure NO fastener visible under compound
4. **Allow proper drying time:**
   - All-purpose compound: 24 hours typical (faster in warm, dry conditions)
   - Check dryness by light tapping (hollow sound = dry; dull thud = wet)
   - Do NOT apply second coat until first coat completely dry

#### Step 7: Sand First Coat (Light Smoothing)
1. **Optional intermediate sanding** (if surface is very uneven or first coat applied thickly):
   - Use 120-grit sandpaper or sanding sponge
   - Sand lightly with pole sander or hand sanding block
   - Remove only high spots and excess compound
   - Vacuum dust thoroughly
2. **Inspect for coverage:**
   - No dark (bare) spots visible through first coat
   - All fastener heads covered
   - Feathered edges smooth without ridges

#### Step 8: Second Coat Application
1. **Mix fresh joint compound** (same consistency as first coat)
2. **Apply wider passes:**
   - Use 10" or 12" taping knife
   - Feather compound 10–12" on each side of first coat
   - Overlap onto bare drywall beyond feathered edge (creates gradual taper)
   - Force compound through first coat to bond layers
3. **Fastener coverage:**
   - Apply fill coats directly over dimples
   - Feather 4–6" around each fastener
4. **Allow drying time:**
   - 24 hours typical for all-purpose compound
   - Ensure complete dryness before third coat

#### Step 9: Sand Second Coat (Smoothing)
1. **Use 150-grit sandpaper or sanding sponge:**
   - Sand all visible compound areas with medium pressure
   - Focus on high spots, ridges, and feather edges
   - Sand wet (using damp sponge) or dry with dust collection
2. **Inspect for smoothness:**
   - No visible ridges or peaks
   - Feathered edges blend gradually into drywall
   - Surface should feel smooth under hand pass

#### Step 10: Third Coat (Final Finish)
1. **Mix finishing compound** (same all-purpose or "topping" compound):
   - Mix to slightly looser consistency (peanut butter to cream soup)
   - Allows better flow and smoothing
2. **Apply final coat:**
   - Use 16" or wider finishing knife (if available)
   - Feather 16–24" beyond second coat to blend with wall
   - Light pressure; let knife do the work (no pushing)
   - Goal: Create virtually invisible taper with no ridges
3. **Pay attention to:**
   - Fastener heads (apply thin skim coat over dimple area)
   - Joint seams (feather edges smoothly)
   - Ceiling drywall (apply thinner coats to prevent sag)
4. **Allow complete drying:**
   - 48+ hours typical before final sanding or primer application
   - Check dryness in corners and along edges (slower to dry)

#### Step 11: Final Sand (Paint Preparation)
1. **Use 150–180 grit sandpaper:**
   - Sand all compound areas with light pressure
   - Focus on: Feather edges, fastener dimples, any ridges or imperfections
   - Ceiling: Sand gently to avoid creating dust clouds
   - Edges: Use sanding sponge in corners for smoother finish
2. **Sanding method:**
   - Wet sanding (damp sponge) preferred to minimize airborne dust
   - Dry sanding: Use dust collection vacuum in-line with sander
3. **Vacuum and wipe down:**
   - Remove all dust with shop vacuum
   - Wipe entire surface with damp sponge or cloth
   - Allow to dry completely (typically 30 minutes to 1 hour)

### 7.3 Caulking & Corner Treatment

#### Step 12: Caulk Exterior Corners & Transitions
1. **Identify locations requiring caulk:**
   - All inside corners (drywall-to-drywall, drywall-to-wall)
   - Any cracks or joints in drywall not covered by tape
   - Transitions from drywall to other materials (trim, doors, windows)
2. **Apply paintable caulk:**
   - Use caulking gun with latex or acrylic paintable caulk
   - Fill gaps completely (no voids >¼")
   - Smooth with wet finger or tool before curing
   - Allow to cure per manufacturer instructions (typically 24 hours)

#### Step 13: Verify Drywall Finish Quality (Pre-Primer)
**Final visual & tactile inspection:**

- [ ] All joints taped and smoothly finished (no visible tape edges)
- [ ] All fastener dimples filled and smooth
- [ ] No cracks, tears, or gouges in surface
- [ ] Ceiling smooth and flat (no sag, ripples, or ridges)
- [ ] All corners caulked and smooth
- [ ] Surface clean and dust-free
- [ ] No water stains or mold
- [ ] Corners crisp and clean

---

### 7.4 Primer Application

#### Step 14: Prepare for Primer Application
1. **Verify drywall is completely dry:**
   - Allow minimum 2–3 days after final sanding
   - Touch test: Surface should feel dry, not cool/clammy
   - Visual: No dark moisture stains
2. **Protect non-drywall surfaces:**
   - Cover electrical outlets, switches, fixtures with tape
   - Lay down drop cloths to protect floors and future trim
3. **Environmental conditions:**
   - Temperature: 50–85°F
   - Humidity: <85%
   - Adequate ventilation (open windows/doors if possible)

#### Step 15: Apply Primer Coat
1. **Mix primer thoroughly:**
   - Stir well if pre-mixed
   - If tinting (for finish paint color matching), mix per specification
2. **Application method (choose one):**
   - **Roller:** Use 3/8"–½" nap roller on extension pole; roll in W pattern then fill in; 350–400 sq.ft./gallon coverage
   - **Brush:** For edges, corners, trim areas; feather into roller application
   - **Spray:** For speed and uniform coverage (requires HVLP sprayer; slower drying may be needed for dust settlement)
3. **Primer application:**
   - Apply 1 full coat to all drywall surfaces (walls, ceiling, soffit)
   - Maintain wet edge to avoid lap marks
   - Apply to all joint compound, fastener dimples, and caulk areas
   - Cover all surfaces uniformly; no missed areas or thin spots
   - Allow to dry per manufacturer (typically 1–2 hours for recoat; 24 hours for light traffic)
4. **Verify coverage:**
   - No drywall white gypsum board visible (all covered)
   - Ceiling primer uniform (no darker or lighter areas)
   - All fastener dimples and joints filled
   - Edges and corners well-covered

#### Step 16: Touch-Up & Final Inspection
1. **Identify any missed spots or thin areas:**
   - Walk entire bay under good lighting
   - Check corners, ceiling, and transitions
2. **Apply touch-up primer:**
   - Small roller or brush application
   - Blend into adjacent areas
   - Allow to dry
