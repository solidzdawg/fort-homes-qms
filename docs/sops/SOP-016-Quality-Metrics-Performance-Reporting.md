## 1. Purpose

To establish procedures for tracking quality metrics, performance indicators, defect analysis, and yield tracking. This SOP ensures visibility into production quality trends, identifies improvement opportunities, and provides management with data-driven performance reports for decision-making and strategic planning.

---

## 2. Scope

This procedure applies to:
- Key performance indicator (KPI) definition and tracking
- Quality defect data collection and categorization
- Yield rate calculations and trend analysis
- Weekly and monthly performance reporting
- Management review data and presentation

**Applies to:** Quality Manager, Production Supervisor, Quality Inspectors, Plant Management

---

## 3. References & Standards

- ISO 9001:2015 Section 8.4.1 (Performance Metrics)
- Hold Point Inspection Records (SOP-013)
- Nonconformance Reports (SOP-004)
- Module Traveler Documentation (SOP-014)

## 5. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### 5.1 Production Quality Metrics

| KPI | Target | Calculation | Review |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| First Pass Yield | 90% | (Modules passing HP-8 / Total modules started) × 100 | Weekly |
| Defect Rate | <2% | (Total defects / Total modules) × 100 | Weekly |
| Inspection Pass Rate | 95% | (Hold points passed first attempt / Total hold points) × 100 | Weekly |
| Schedule Adherence | 95% | (On-time completions / Total completions) × 100 | Weekly |

### 5.2 Customer Quality Metrics

| KPI | Target | Calculation | Review |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Field Failure Rate | <1% | (Warranty claims / Modules delivered) × 100 | Monthly |
| Customer Returns | <5 modules | Modules returned for defects | Monthly |
| Warranty Cost | <$5K/month | Total warranty rework costs | Monthly |

## 6. Defect Tracking & Analysis

### 6.1 Defect Categorization
- Structural defects (framing, fastening, alignment)
- System defects (electrical, plumbing, HVAC)
- Cosmetic defects (finishing, paint, trim)
- Documentation defects (traveler, inspection records)

### 6.2 Root Cause Analysis
Defects trending above target trigger SPC (Statistical Process Control) investigation. Quality Manager analyzes by phase, work center, and time period. Root causes identified and corrective actions assigned per SOP-004.

## 7. Performance Reporting

Weekly metrics email to supervisors and plant manager. Monthly performance report includes KPI trends, defect Pareto analysis, and improvement recommendations. Quarterly management review presents data for strategic decisions.
