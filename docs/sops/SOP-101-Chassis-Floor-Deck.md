- [ ] Engineered plans reviewed and in Bay Supervisor's hands (legible, current stamp)
- [ ] Chassis frame identified and scheduled for positioning
- [ ] Materials on-site or confirmed delivery date (no delayed starts)
- [ ] Bay work area cleaned and prepared for chassis positioning
- [ ] Crew briefing completed (SOP walkthrough, daily safety toolbox talk)
- [ ] Pneumatic pressure tested and adjusted (100–120 psi)
- [ ] Adhesive mixed per manufacturer instructions; temperature suitable (typically 50°F+)
- [ ] All fasteners counted and verified against fastener schedule
- [ ] NCR log reviewed; previous phase hold-points resolved

---

## 7. Detailed Procedure

### 7.1 Chassis Receipt & Positioning

#### Step 1: Inspect Incoming Chassis
1. Visual inspection for shipping damage (cracks, bends, rust scale)
2. Verify model number and configuration match order/plan
3. Confirm steel certifications and mill reports on file
4. Check axle condition and wheel hubs (if not yet removed)
5. Document any defects on **Receiving Inspection Form** (SOP-006)

#### Step 2: Position in Bay
1. Use forklift or crane to position chassis in designated bay
2. Place on leveling blocks or shims to establish plane
3. Verify chassis is centered on floor (measure from walls)
4. Use laser level or transit to verify chassis plane (tolerance: ±¼" across length)
5. Secure loose items; remove or pin axles if applicable

---

### 7.2 Subfloor Joist Installation

#### Step 3: Prepare Joist Layout
1. **Reference the engineered plans** — note joist size, spacing (typical: 16" or 24" o.c.), and rim board details
2. **Mark rim board** with layout lines at joist intervals using chalk line and pencil
3. **Measure diagonals** — verify frame squareness (diagonals must differ by ≤¼")
4. If frame is out of square >¼", flag with red tag and escalate to Bay Supervisor before proceeding

#### Step 4: Install Rim Boards & Blocking
1. Cut and fit rim boards (LVL or 2x) to chassis perimeter
2. Apply construction adhesive to top of chassis frame (full coverage, ¼" bead)
3. Set rim boards; fasten per **Fastener Schedule** (typical: 16d nails @ 12" o.c. or equivalent)
4. Install corner blocks and bracing per engineered plan
5. Verify rim board is level and flush with chassis frame

#### Step 5: Install Floor Joists (I-Joists or Dimensional Lumber)
1. **For each joist location:**
   - Apply construction adhesive to joist bearing point on chassis/rim (¼" bead, full contact)
   - Set joist in marked position, ensuring crown is up
   - Install fasteners per **Fastener Schedule** (typical: 3 × 16d nails or equivalent fastener)
   - Verify joist is plumb (use level on flange)
   - Check spacing against chalk lines (tolerance: ±½")

2. **Install blocking/bridging** per engineered plan (prevents joist rotation, distributes loads)
   - Cut blocks to snug fit between joists
   - Fasten with per schedule (typically 2 nails per end per joist)

3. **Verify joist alignment:**
   - Use straightedge or sight line along joist crowns
   - Maximum deviation: ±¼" over 16-foot length
   - If deviation exceeds tolerance, shim with approved shims or replace joist

---

### 7.3 Subfloor Sheathing Installation

#### Step 6: Prepare & Install Sheathing
1. **Verify sheathing material:** Grade stamp visible, OSB/plywood in good condition (no moisture staining, swelling, or delamination)
2. **Acclimate material** if environment temperature < 50°F or humidity > 85% (wait 24 hours minimum)
3. **Layout sheathing:** Arrange panels perpendicular to joists, stagger end joints
4. **Snap chalk lines** at joist centers for fastener guidance
5. **Leave expansion gap** of ⅛" at all perimeter edges (walls, rim boards) to allow for seasonal movement

#### Step 7: Glue & Fasten Sheathing
1. **Apply adhesive** to all joist tops that support sheathing:
   - Notched trowel (¼" × ⅜" notch) or adhesive bead pattern
   - Ensure continuous bead with no voids or gaps
   - Adhesive must be compatible with sheathing type and joist material

2. **Set sheathing panel:**
   - Press firmly onto joists and rim board
   - Squeeze-out should be visible at joist marks

3. **Fasten per schedule** (typical fastener pattern):
   - **Edges:** 6" on center (perpendicular to joists)
   - **Field (interior):** 12" on center in both directions
   - **Fastener type:** Ring-shank nails (8d or 10d) or approved structural screws
   - **Penetration:** Fasteners must embed fully without crushing sheathing

4. **Verify fastening:**
   - No "shiners" (missed joists) — check from below
   - No fastener pops or voids (tap all fasteners for sound fastening)
   - Pattern matches fastener schedule photograph/diagram

#### Step 8: Install Additional Sheathing & Prepare for MEP
1. Continue sheathing installation until subfloor is fully covered
2. Install any house-wrap or vapor barrier per engineered plan (if not deferred to later phase)
3. Mark joist locations on top of sheathing (chalk line or paint) for framing reference
4. Mark plumbing/HVAC penetration locations per house plan (use template or stencil)

---

### 7.4 Below-Floor MEP Installation (if applicable)

#### Step 9: Install Drain Lines & Supply Stubouts
1. **Plumbing crew** installs drain lines, vent pipes, and supply stubs beneath subfloor per house plan
2. **Verify locations** match engineered framing plan (drain lines must not cross structural members without header/reinforcement)
3. **Secure all lines** to frame with clamps or straps to prevent movement during shipping
4. **Test drains** (if required): Pressure test per code or visual integrity check
5. **Cap all open ends** with plugs or caps to prevent contamination

#### Step 10: Verify MEP Rough-In
1. Photograph all below-floor MEP before sheathing, if not already covered
2. Verify supply lines do not protrude above subfloor
3. Confirm all connections are accessible or properly routed
4. Document any deviations from plan as NCR

---

### 7.5 Quality Control & Pre-Inspection Preparation

#### Step 11: Self-Inspection by Crew
**Before HP-1 inspection,** the Bay Supervisor and framing crew conduct a self-check:

- [ ] Diagonals are square (difference ≤¼")
- [ ] Joist spacing matches plan (spot-check minimum 5 locations)
- [ ] Adhesive squeeze-out visible at ≥80% of joist intersections
- [ ] Fastener pattern matches schedule (no shiners, even penetration)
- [ ] Subfloor is flush, no soft spots, no visible gaps
- [ ] All penetrations marked and verified against plan
- [ ] Below-floor MEP secured and intact
- [ ] No debris or damage to subfloor after MEP rough-in
- [ ] All materials certificates of compliance filed

#### Step 12: Document & Schedule HP-1 Inspection
1. Prepare **FORM-I001** (Floor System Inspection Checklist) — fill in job details
2. Contact QA/TPIA to schedule **HP-1** hold-point inspection
3. Notify Production Manager of estimated inspection date
4. Ensure bay is clean and accessible for inspector walkthrough

---
