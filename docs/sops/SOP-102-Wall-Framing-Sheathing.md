## 7. Detailed Procedure

### 7.1 Wall Preparation & Bottom Plate Installation

#### Step 1: Verify Subfloor Condition
1. Walk entire subfloor; check for soft spots, humps, or debris
2. Clean subfloor surface (sweep/vacuum) where plates will sit
3. Verify subfloor is flat and dry (use straightedge or laser level if in doubt)
4. Mark wall center lines on subfloor using chalk and tape measure (reference house plan)

#### Step 2: Lay Out Bottom Plates
1. **For pressure-treated (PT) bottom plates** (required below-grade or in wet zones):
   - Verify PT stamp is visible on each plate
   - PT lumber is denser; confirms rot resistance
2. **Dry-fit plate locations:**
   - Align bottom plates to chalk lines (perpendicular to floor joists, typical spacing)
   - Verify frame openings (doors, windows) align with subfloor layout
   - Check corners are square using carpenter's square (check at 3' and full corner)
3. **Mark stud locations** on bottom plate:
   - Use chalk line or pencil marks at 16" o.c. or 24" o.c. (per plan)
   - Mark "X" on stud side (helps crew orient studs)
   - Mark all openings (doors, windows, mechanical penetrations)

#### Step 3: Fasten Bottom Plates
1. **Apply construction adhesive** to subfloor (if structural):
   - ¼" bead under plate bearing surface (optional but recommended)
   - Improves racking resistance and eliminates squeaking
2. **Fasten plates to subfloor** per **Fastener Schedule**:
   - Typical: 16d nails @ 16" o.c. through bottom plate into floor joists
   - Fasteners must hit floor joists (do not fastener into subfloor alone; insufficient holding power)
   - Drive nails perpendicular to wall direction
3. **Verify plate is level:**
   - Use 4-foot level along length of plate
   - Tolerance: ±¼" per 8 feet
   - If out of level, shim plate with cedar shims under stud locations

---

### 7.2 Wall Framing (SIP or Stick-Built)

#### Step 4A: Install Pre-Fabricated SIP Panels (if applicable)

**SIP Panel Method:**

1. **Prepare panels per manufacturer specification:**
   - Check moisture content (typically ≤12% for OSB faces)
   - Verify panel dimensions match house plan openings
   - Inspect for shipping damage (cracks in OSB or EPS core)

2. **Set first panel:**
   - Position panel vertically over bottom plate
   - Align edge with outer wall line (use chalk line as guide)
   - Check plumb using 6-foot level on panel face (tolerance: ±¼" per 8' height)
   - Panel should rest on bottom plate with full contact; no rocking

3. **Fasten first panel:**
   - Install spline (if required by panel design) into groove
   - Fasten panel to bottom plate per manufacturer schedule:
     - Typical: Pneumatic nails or structural screws @ 12" o.c.
     - Fasteners through OSB face into framing/core
   - Fasten top of panel (if top plate already set) or prepare for top plate installation

4. **Continue panel installation:**
   - Each subsequent panel splines to previous panel
   - Ensure joints are tight (no gaps)
   - Verify panel faces are plumb throughout installation
   - Install blocking or backer at panel-to-panel joints per manufacturer

5. **Install edge blocking & connections per plan:**
   - Simpson straps or structural connectors at corners
   - Blocking at window/door headers
   - Fastening per engineer detail

6. **Cut openings for windows/doors:**
   - Use power saw or hand saw (carefully; OSB dust is fine)
   - Cut from inside face to reduce tear-out on outside face
   - Install bucks (frames) as described in Step 4B

#### Step 4B: Stick-Built Wall Framing (Alternative)

**Dimensional Lumber Method:**

1. **Assemble wall section (bottom plate + studs + top plate):**
   - Dry-fit studs on bottom plate; verify stud spacing matches marks
   - Stand studs upright; check for crown (slight upward curve)
   - If crowned, crown should face outward (toward exterior sheathing)

2. **Install studs:**
   - Fasten each stud to bottom plate:
     - Typical: 2 × 16d nails, toe-nailed at 10–15° angle (one per side of stud)
     - Alternately, use structural screws per schedule
   - As studs are installed, continue installing top plate along top of studs

3. **Install top plate:**
   - Set top plate on studs; verify alignment and perpendicularity
   - Fasten studs to top plate:
     - Typical: 2 × 16d nails per stud, toe-nailed
     - Alternately, structural screws or hardware per schedule

4. **Install structural bracing:**
   - Diagonal bracing (1×4 or 2×4, typically) or
   - Let-in bracing (notched into studs) or
   - Wall sheathing (OSB) provides lateral bracing in modern construction
   - Per engineered plan; do NOT omit

5. **Install blocking & backing:**
   - Horizontal blocking between studs for drywall edges (typically 16" o.c.)
   - Blocking at corners for drywall fastening
   - Headers over window/door openings (installed before top plate)

---

### 7.3 Window & Door Buck Installation

#### Step 5: Prepare & Install Window Bucks

**Window Opening Preparation:**

1. **Measure rough opening dimensions** per house plan:
   - Width and height from floor to header
   - Compare against window unit specifications (should be 1–2" larger than sash for shims)

2. **Verify opening is square** (using carpenter's square or laser):
   - Measure diagonals; difference should be ≤¼"
   - If out of square, adjust framing before installing window

3. **Install window buck frame** (pressure-treated lumber):
   - Frame dimensions = rough opening + allowance for shims
   - Fasten frame to studs around opening per schedule
   - Verify buck is plumb and level (check on all four sides)

4. **Install window unit:**
   - Set window in frame; shim sides and top for plumb/level
   - Fasten window per manufacturer instructions (fasteners through frame into studs)
   - Verify window operates smoothly (open/close without binding)

#### Step 6: Prepare & Install Door Bucks

**Door Opening Preparation:**

1. **Verify door opening height and width** per house plan
   - Typical interior door: 32"–36" wide, 80" tall
   - Typical exterior door: 36" wide, 80" tall

2. **Install door frame** (buck):
   - Set frame in opening; shim for plumb and level
   - Verify frame corners are square (diagonal measurement)
   - Fasten per schedule (typically 2 × 16d nails per stud, through jamb)

3. **Verify clearance:**
   - Door swings freely without binding
   - Clearance at floor for carpet/flooring thickness (if applicable)

---

### 7.4 Exterior Sheathing & WRB Installation

#### Step 7: Install Exterior Sheathing (if not pre-installed on SIP panels)

1. **Verify sheathing material:**
   - Grade stamp visible (APA rated, typically APA-OSB or APA-Plywood)
   - Material is dry (no water staining or swelling)
   - Correct thickness per plan (typical: ½" or ⅝")

2. **Layout sheathing:**
   - Arrange panels horizontally (long dimension perpendicular to studs)
   - Stagger vertical joints (offset at least 16" between rows)
   - Leave ⅛" expansion gap at all edges and around window/door openings

3. **Install sheathing:**
   - Fasten to studs per **Fastener Schedule**:
     - Typical: 8d nails @ 12" o.c. at edges, 12" o.c. field (staggered pattern)
     - Or structural screws per schedule
   - Ensure fasteners hit studs (no shiners)
   - No fastener pops or crushing of sheathing edges

4. **Verify sheathing flatness:**
   - Walk across sheathing; feel for soft spots or depressions
   - Use straightedge to check for waviness (tolerance: ±¼" over 10 feet)

---

#### Step 8: Install Weather-Resistive Barrier (WRB)

**WRB Application Method** (using Tyvek or equivalent as example):

1. **Prepare substrate:**
   - Sheathing surface clean and dry
   - No sharp protrusions, fastener heads must be recessed
   - Temperature 40°F+ (moisture cannot be trapped under WRB in cold)

2. **Unroll WRB material:**
   - Lay out horizontally, bottom edge first (builds laps downward)
   - Overlap seams by minimum 6" (horizontal) and 9" (vertical)
   - Do NOT stretch material; allow slight sag

3. **Fasten WRB:**
   - Fasten with corrosion-resistant fasteners (typically ringed-shank cap nails):
     - Spacing: 12" o.c. in a grid pattern (every 12" horizontally and vertically)
     - Fasteners driven through cap (not through WRB face alone; cap distributes load)
   - Fastener spacing should match staple pattern shown on WRB roll

4. **Seal laps and penetrations:**
   - Use WRB-compatible tape (e.g., Tyvek Seam Tape) to seal:
     - All horizontal and vertical seams
     - Corners and penetrations (vents, fixtures, pipes)
     - Flashing interfaces (see Step 9)
   - Tape application: Press firmly; ensure full contact with no wrinkles

5. **Extend WRB around openings:**
   - WRB should wrap around window/door frames, bucks, extending 6"+ beyond opening
   - Tape and seal at frame corners and edges

---

#### Step 9: Install Flashing (Window/Door Openings)

**Flashing Installation Per WRB Manufacturer Detail:**

1. **Above window/door openings** (Head Flashing):
   - Install flashing tape or metal flashing above window frame
   - Flashing should slope outward and downward (prevents water pooling)
   - Extend beyond opening width on each side (minimum 2–3")
   - Tape seal at sides where flashing meets WRB

2. **Below window openings** (Sill Flashing):
   - Install sill pan or flashing tape under window sill
   - Create slight slope downward and outward
   - Extend beyond opening width on sides
   - Ensure any weeps (drain holes) in flashing are clear

3. **Sides of openings** (Jamb Flashing):
   - Apply flashing tape or liquid flashing down sides of opening
   - Ensure flashing is continuous from header to sill
   - Tape seal to adjacent WRB

4. **Testing flashing seal:**
   - Spray water test (optional) during installation:
     - Spray water over flashing at moderate pressure
     - Water should run down and out, not penetrate behind opening or flashing
   - Verify all seams and laps are taped and sealed
