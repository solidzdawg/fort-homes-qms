---

## 5. Nonconformance Identification & Reporting

### 5.1 Nonconformance Sources

Nonconformances can be identified through:
- **Production inspection:** Hold point failures, dimensional issues
- **Final inspection:** Defects discovered at module completion
- **Customer complaint:** Issues reported after delivery
- **Internal audit:** Procedure not followed or records missing
- **Management review:** Process not achieving objectives
- **Supplier delivery:** Received materials not meeting specs
- **Employee report:** Team member identifies issue

### 5.2 Nonconformance Report (NCR) Initiation

**Anyone identifying a nonconformance must:**
1. Immediately notify supervisor
2. Isolate affected product (stop work if safety issue)
3. Document what was observed
4. Complete Nonconformance Report form (FORM-NCR01)
5. Submit to Quality Manager
6. Supervisor ensures no further nonconforming work

## 6. Nonconformance Investigation & Analysis

### 6.1 Root Cause Analysis Process

**Within 5 days of NCR initiation:**

1. **Gather Data**
   - Collect all relevant information
   - Review work instructions and actual practice
   - Interview involved personnel
   - Examine similar products/processes

2. **Identify Contributing Factors**
   - Equipment failure?
   - Procedure not clear or followed?
   - Training/competency issue?
   - Environmental factor?
   - Supplier material issue?

3. **Determine Root Cause**
   - Use "5 Why" analysis
   - Ask: Why did nonconformance occur?
   - Keep asking "Why" until true cause found
   - Avoid symptom-fixing

### 5 Why Analysis Example

```
Issue: Floor deck assembled with ¾" gap between joists

Why 1: Installer didn't measure spacing
  → Why didn't they measure?

Why 2: Tape measure not available at workstation
  → Why not available?

Why 3: Tools not issued at shift start
  → Why not procedure?

Why 4: No tool management system exists
  → Why no system?

Root Cause: Lack of formal tool management procedure
```

### 6.2 Root Cause Analysis Form

## 8. Preventive Action (PACTION)

### 8.1 Preventive Action Triggers

Consider preventive actions for:
- Potential issues identified in audits (observations)
- Process changes being implemented
- New product variations
- Supplier changes
- Equipment upgrades
- High-risk areas

### 8.2 PACTION Process

Same as corrective action but focused on preventing potential issues:

1. **Identify potential problem** (before it occurs)
2. **Analyze root cause** of why it might happen
3. **Develop preventive action** to eliminate risk
4. **Implement change**
5. **Verify effectiveness** that problem doesn't occur

---

## 9. Corrective Action Follow-Up & Closure

### 9.1 Implementation Tracking

**During implementation:**
- Monitor progress against timeline
- Address obstacles immediately
- Communicate status to stakeholders
- Adjust as needed

### 9.2 Effectiveness Verification

**After implementation:**
- Verify corrective action was implemented
- Check that procedure was changed (if needed)
- Verify training was completed
- Monitor process for 30 days minimum
- Look for recurrence of issue

### 9.3 NCR Closure Criteria

NCR can be closed when:
- ✅ Corrective action implemented
- ✅ Effectiveness verified (issue resolved)
- ✅ Related procedure updated and trained
- ✅ No recurrence within 30-day monitoring
- ✅ Quality Manager approval obtained

---

## 10. Nonconformance Metrics & Trends

### 10.1 Tracking & Trending

Track:
- Number of NCRs by month
- Types of nonconformances
- Repeat issues (NCRs for same problem)
- Average closure time
- Most common root causes
- Department/area trends

### 10.2 Metrics Review

| Metric | Target | Review Frequency |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| NCR Closure Rate | 100% within 30 days | Monthly |
| Repeat NCRs | <10% | Quarterly |
| Average days to close | <15 days | Monthly |
| CAPA Effectiveness | >95% | Quarterly |

### 10.3 Trend Analysis

**If trends show:**
- Increase in NCRs → Escalate issue; request increased resources
- Repeat NCRs → Previous CAPA not effective; reassess
- Same root cause → System-level improvement needed
- New area of concern → Target additional training/auditing

---

## 11. Customer Complaint Handling

### 11.1 Customer Issue Process

For complaints received after delivery:

1. **Initial Contact** (within 24 hours)
   - Listen to customer concern
   - Document details
   - Empathize and acknowledge
   - Explain process

2. **Investigation** (within 5 days)
   - Inspect returned module or photograph
   - Determine if manufacturing defect
   - If yes → Open NCR
   - If no → Customer education/support

3. **Resolution**
   - If defect → Follow CAPA process
   - If not defect → Document and close
   - Keep customer informed

4. **Follow-Up** (after resolution)
   - Verify customer satisfaction
   - Document outcome
   - Share learnings with team
