• Review work instructions and actual practice
• Interview involved personnel
• Examine similar products/processes

**STEP 2: IDENTIFY CONTRIBUTING FACTORS**

• Equipment failure?
• Procedure not clear or followed?
• Training/competency issue?
• Environmental factor?
• Supplier material issue?

**STEP 3: DETERMINE ROOT CAUSE**

• Use "5 Why" analysis
• Ask: Why did nonconformance occur?
• Keep asking "Why" until true cause found
• Avoid symptom-fixing

### 6.2 5 Why Analysis Example


**5 WHY ANALYSIS EXAMPLE**

🔴 ISSUE: Floor deck assembled with ¾" gap between joists
Why 1: Installer didn't measure spacing
