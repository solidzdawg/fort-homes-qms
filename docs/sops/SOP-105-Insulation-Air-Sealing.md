## 7. Detailed Procedure

### 7.1 Pre-Insulation Preparation & Air Barrier Installation

#### Step 1: Inspect Framing & Identify Air Leakage Points
1. Walk the perimeter and all interior walls to identify openings:
   - Rim board/sill plate junctions
   - Band cavity (between rim board and subfloor framing)
   - Electrical outlet/switch boxes protruding into walls
   - HVAC duct penetrations
   - Plumbing vent pipes and drain lines
   - Roof/wall intersections (at soffit/fascia)
2. Document all penetrations on **Insulation Layout Drawing** (sketched on plan copy)
3. Flag any large gaps (>½") with tape for immediate sealing

#### Step 2: Install Air Barrier (House Wrap / Exterior Sheathing)
1. **If exterior house wrap not yet installed:**
   - Unfold wrap carefully to avoid tears
   - Begin at bottom of wall; overlap courses ≥6 inches
   - Secure with staples (12" o.c. along framing and 6" o.c. at seams and corners)
   - Seal all seams with compatible tape (typically polyethylene or butyl)
   - Cut openings for windows/doors; fold tape into corners for airtight seal
2. **Verify continuity:**
   - No gaps or tears >1 inch in any direction
   - All seams sealed with tape; no exposed overlaps

#### Step 3: Seal Penetrations & Transitions (Pre-Insulation)
1. **Electrical outlets/switches in exterior walls:**
   - Apply caulk or foam sealant around box perimeter on interior side
   - Use acoustic sealant or fire-rated caulk for exterior penetrations
2. **HVAC ducts at wall:**
   - Seal with mastic and fabric mesh or acoustic sealant
3. **Plumbing pipes at rim board:**
   - Apply foam sealant or caulk around pipes where they exit rim cavity
4. **Roof/wall penetrations (soffit & fascia):**
   - Seal with caulk or foam; ensure air cannot bypass insulation
5. Let all sealants cure per manufacturer instructions before proceeding

### 7.2 Wall Insulation Installation

#### Step 4: Install Wall Cavity Insulation (Batts / Blown-In)
1. **For fiberglass or rock wool batts:**
   - Verify R-value printed on batt wrapper (e.g., R-13, R-15)
   - Insert batts between studs with vapor retarder side facing warm side (typically interior)
   - Ensure batt fills stud cavity completely; no compression or gaps
   - Staple flanges at top and bottom of cavity (typically every 16–24 inches)
   - Trim excess with utility knife; do not compress batt to fit tight
   - **Depth verification:** Batt thickness should fill cavity with ≤½" compression

2. **For blown-in cellulose:**
   - Install netting or temporary drywall panels to retain loose fill during installation
   - Follow blower operator's density recommendations (typically 2.0–2.5 lb/cu.ft.)
   - Fill cavity to target depth per engineered R-value schedule
   - Verify depth with measuring rod or depth gauge at multiple locations (min. 5 per wall section)
   - Remove netting only after insulation has settled (typically 24–48 hours)

3. **For spray foam (closed-cell):**
   - Only certified spray applicators perform installation
   - Follow two-part system mixing ratios precisely per manufacturer instructions
   - Spray to fill entire cavity; allow slight overspray at framing face (trim flush with frame)
   - Do not compress or disturb spray foam until fully cured (per product SDS, typically 24 hours)
   - **R-value:** Approximately R-7 per inch; verify thickness to meet engineered R-value

#### Step 5: Verify Wall Insulation Completeness
1. **Spot-check batt installation (minimum 5 locations per wall):**
   - Verify stud cavity completely filled (no gaps at top, bottom, or sides)
   - Check for any "cold spots" (misaligned batts, voids)
   - Confirm depth matches specification
2. **Inspect for compression or damage:**
   - No crushed batts (compression reduces R-value)
   - No tears, wet spots, or mold on insulation material
3. **Electrical outlet/switch boxes:**
   - Insulation cut and fit around boxes (no void behind boxes)
   - Box is sealed with caulk or foam on interior edges

---

### 7.3 Ceiling & Roof Insulation

#### Step 6: Install Ceiling/Attic Insulation
1. **For blown-in ceiling insulation:**
   - Install baffles in each rafter bay if not already in place (to allow soffit ventilation)
   - Blow insulation to target depth per engineered R-value schedule (e.g., R-38, R-49)
   - Measure depth with rod or gauge at multiple locations (min. 10 random spots across ceiling)
   - Record depths in **Insulation Verification Log** (Section 7.8)
   - Ensure insulation does not obstruct any soffit or ridge vents (maintain ≥1 inch air gap)

2. **For batt ceiling insulation:**
   - Install batts between rafters or joist cavities
   - Ensure vapor retarder side faces warm (interior) side
   - Staple flanges to frame; no compression
   - Install baffles at each rafter bay (if ventilation required per code)
   - Verify batt depth matches specification

3. **At roof/wall intersection (soffit/fascia line):**
   - Install rigid foam or batts to fill band cavity (rim board area)
   - Seal air gaps between insulation and frame with caulk or foam
   - Do NOT block soffit vents; maintain clear air pathway to ridge vent

#### Step 7: Verify Ceiling Insulation & Attic Continuity
1. Visually inspect ceiling for:
   - No visible gaps or thin areas
   - Insulation depth consistent across attic/roof space
   - No settling or compaction evident
2. Measure depth at random locations (min. 10 spots):
   - If depth <95% of specified, plan re-blowing or supplemental installation
3. Photograph attic/ceiling space for quality verification

### 7.4 Rim Board & Band Cavity Insulation

#### Step 8: Insulate Rim Board Cavity (Band)
1. **Identify rim cavity location:**
   - Area between rim board (exterior) and subfloor/first-floor framing (interior)
   - Typically 1.5–7.5 inches deep depending on chassis/framing configuration
2. **Install insulation:**
   - **Option A (Batts):** Cut rigid foam or batts to fit cavity depth; staple in place; caulk all edges
   - **Option B (Spray Foam):** Apply closed-cell spray foam to fill entire cavity; trim flush with rim board face
   - **Option C (Rigid Foam Boards):** Fit XPS or polyiso boards; tape all seams and edges with foil tape
3. **Seal all edges:**
   - Caulk seam between insulation and rim board (interior & exterior)
   - Caulk where insulation meets subfloor/floor framing
   - Ensure no air gap >¼" remains

#### Step 9: Verify Rim Insulation Continuity
1. Inspect from both interior and exterior:
   - No visible gaps or voids in insulation
   - All seams sealed with caulk or tape
   - Foam or batt fills cavity evenly
2. Check thermal continuity with infrared thermometer (optional):
   - Rim board temperature should be similar to adjacent wall insulation area (within 5°F)
   - Cold spots indicate air infiltration or missing insulation

### 7.5 Air Sealing & Vapor Retarder Installation

#### Step 10: Install Vapor Retarder / Smart Barrier
1. **Determine vapor retarder requirement from engineered plan:**
   - Climate zone determines type (traditional poly, kraft, or permeable membrane)
   - Typically installed on warm side of insulation (interior face)
2. **For polyfilm (6-mil typical):**
   - Unroll across wall cavity; secure with staples every 16–24 inches
   - Overlap seams ≥6 inches
   - Seal all seams with polyethylene tape or mastic
   - Cut openings for outlets, vents; fold tape around edges for airtightness
3. **For kraft-faced batts:**
   - Kraft paper serves as vapor retarder; fasten flanges securely to studs
   - Tape all seams between adjacent batts and at wall intersections
4. **For permeable membranes:**
   - Install per manufacturer instructions (orientation matters for some products)
   - Overlap seams; seal with compatible tape

#### Step 11: Caulk All Penetrations (Final Air Sealing Pass)
1. **Inspect each penetration location identified in Step 1:**
   - Electrical outlets, switches, conduit
   - HVAC ducts and returns at walls
   - Plumbing vents and drain lines
   - Wall/ceiling intersections (top plate connections)
   - Rim board junctions with subfloor
2. **Apply caulk/sealant:**
   - Use caulking gun for precision application
   - Fill voids around penetrations completely (no voids >¼")
   - For fire-rated applications (exterior wall or between units), use fire-rated caulk per code
   - Allow caulk to cure per manufacturer instructions before drywall installation
3. **Seal top plates:**
   - If vapor retarder is polyfilm, seal where it meets top plate with tape or mastic
   - If using spray foam, ensure foam contacts top plate and blocking members completely
