## 7. Detailed Procedure

### 7.1 Electrical Rough-In

#### Step 1: Prepare Electrical Layout & Panel Placement
1. **Verify electrical plans:** Breaker panel location, main disconnect size, circuit schedule legible and on-site
2. **Locate breaker panel:** Typically at main entry, outside, garage, or utility room per code and plan
3. **Check panel location clearance:** Minimum 36" working clearance in front of panel per NEC 110.26
4. **Plan cable routing:** Identify routes for feeder cable from meter/disconnect to appliances and lighting circuits
5. **Identify protected/unprotected areas:** Determine if cable runs through conditioned space or exterior/wet locations (affects cable type requirements)

#### Step 2: Install Main Disconnect Switch & Breaker Panel
1. **Fasten panel to wall:** Secure breaker panel to exterior wall or interior location per plan (typically 48"–60" height, center)
2. **Install main disconnect breaker:** Set main breaker (typically 200A or 400A) in top slot of panel
3. **Verify panel labeling:** Panel is rated for location (wet/damp rating if in wet location); breaker amperage matches main service size
4. **Ground bus installation:** Verify ground bus (typically one per panel) is properly connected to ground rod or house ground (See Step 3)
5. **Neutral bus installation:** Verify neutral bus is isolated from ground bus (common mistake; neutral NOT bonded to ground at sub-panels)

#### Step 3: Install Ground System
1. **Ground rod installation:** Minimum 8-foot ground rod driven into earth at panel location (per NEC 250.52)
2. **Ground conductor:** Continuous bare copper or green insulation from ground rod to ground lug on breaker panel
3. **Size ground conductor:** Typically #6 or #8 copper based on main breaker amperage (see NEC Table 250.66)
4. **Test continuity:** Multimeter test between ground rod and panel ground lug; should show <1 ohm (very low resistance)
5. **Bonding:** Ensure metal water line (if present) and gas line are bonded to ground system per code

#### Step 4: Route Electrical Feeder & Branch Circuits
1. **Feeder cable routing:** Run main feeder from meter/service to breaker panel disconnect:
   - Protect exposed cable in conduit if in wet locations or where damage likely
   - Secure cable to framing every 4.5 feet with staples or straps
   - Maintain proper clearance from plumbing and HVAC (minimum 1" separation if possible)

2. **Branch circuit installation:**
   - Route NM cable (Romex) from breaker panel to light/switch boxes and outlets per circuit schedule
   - Identify each circuit by location on circuit diagram; tape label at each breaker for clarity
   - Secure cable to framing every 4.5 feet; protect cable in conduit if running through walls exposed to impact

#### Step 5: Install Outlet & Switch Boxes
1. **Locate box positions:** Follow electrical plan for outlet heights (typically 12" AFF for outlets, 48" AFF for switches)
2. **Cut rough-openings:** Drill or cut holes in framing for boxes; ensure adequate wall thickness for box mounting
3. **Install boxes:** Fasten electrical boxes to framing with nails or brackets; ensure boxes are flush with future wall surface (account for drywall thickness)
4. **Feed cables:** Insert NM cables into boxes; ensure proper cable clamp or connector at each box entry
5. **Box fill verification:** Confirm box has adequate volume per conductor count (see NEC Table 314.16)
6. **Leave cable slack:** Leave minimum 6 inches of unsheathed conductor in each box for device connections (Phase-5)

#### Step 6: Install Disconnect Switches for Major Appliances

3. **Rough-in supply cable:** Run feeder cable from breaker to disconnect location; terminate with lugs (splicing not allowed in many codes)
4. **Label clearly:** Mark each disconnect with appliance name and breaker number

#### Step 7: Install GFCI Outlets (Wet Locations)
1. **Identify wet locations:** Kitchen counters, bathrooms, laundry areas, garages, exterior locations (per NEC 210.8)
2. **GFCI type:** Install GFCI-protected outlets (self-protected GFCI outlets) or GFCI breakers (if protecting multiple outlets on circuit)
3. **Installation location:** Kitchen counters require GFCI within 6 feet of sink; bathroom requires GFCI within 6 feet of water source
4. **Proper wiring:** GFCI outlet with downstream standard outlets can provide protection if "load" terminals used for downstream protection
5. **Label:** Mark GFCI outlets and protected outlets with "GFCI Protected" label

#### Step 8: Rough-In Verification by Electrical Crew
1. **Circuit continuity test:** Use multimeter to test continuity from breaker through all devices to verify connections

## 11. Hold Point (HP-4) Inspection & Third-Party Coordination

**Coordination with Licensed MEP Inspector / TPIA:**

1. **Inspection scheduling:** Bay Supervisor or MEP Coordinator submits inspection request to AHJ or licensed inspector ≥3 days prior
2. **Inspection scope:** Inspector verifies all code compliance items per FORM-I004; issues written inspection report
3. **Pressure test results:** Inspector reviews and verifies all test reports (water pressure, gas pressure, DWV smoke test); must be signed by responsible technician
4. **Deficiency identification:** Inspector flags any code violations, improper installations, or missing components
5. **Approval:**
   - **PASS** → Inspector signs off on FORM-I004; bay status changes to "Ready for Phase-5"; drywall/interior finish work can proceed
   - **FAIL** → Inspector issues deficiency list; NCR generated for each item; rework scheduled; re-inspection after correction
6. **Documentation:**
   - Inspector signature on FORM-I004 required for approval
