## 7. Detailed Procedure

### 7.1 Truss Delivery, Inspection & Storage

#### Step 1: Receive & Inspect Trusses
1. **Visual inspection** of all delivered trusses for shipping damage (splits, cracks, bends, tears)
2. Verify model number, quantity, and configuration match engineered design and packing slip
3. Check for design-tag accuracy and engineer stamp/approval on trusses
4. Inspect bearing points and connector plates for straightness and integrity
5. Document any defects on **Receiving Inspection Form** (SOP-006); photograph major damage
6. Confirm moisture content ≤18% (use pinless moisture meter spot-check if environment is damp)

#### Step 2: Organize & Stage Trusses
1. Sort trusses by type (main roof, collar tie, scissor truss, etc.) and position in bay
2. Stack trusses flat or on edge per design engineer recommendations (typically flat-stacked)
3. Place stickers/spacers between layers to prevent moisture trapping and deformation
4. Protect trusses from ground contact and water exposure during staging
5. Ensure truss stack is stable and will not shift during wall-top work

---

### 7.2 Prepare Walls & Verify Top-of-Wall Elevation

#### Step 3: Verify Top Plate & Wall Height
1. Measure top-of-wall elevation at multiple locations (minimum 4 corners, 2 midpoints per 40' length)
2. Verify top plate is level (tolerance: ±½" across width for bearing verification)
3. Measure total wall height per plan (including sill, framing, plates)
4. Check that wall diagonals are square; building perimeter matches plan dimensions (±¼" acceptable)
5. If wall height variance >½", address with shims or correction before truss placement

#### Step 4: Prepare Wall Top for Bearing
1. Clean top plate of debris, dust, and old adhesive
2. Apply construction adhesive to entire bearing surface of top plate (full width, ¼" bead)
3. Mark truss spacing and location lines on top plate using chalk line at engineered intervals (typical: 24" o.c. for residential roof)
4. Locate and mark any load points (interior bearing walls, posts, etc.) that support trusses

---

### 7.3 Truss Installation

#### Step 5: Position & Fasten First Truss
1. **Placement:** With crew assistance, position first truss (typically end truss or gable truss) on mark
2. **Alignment:** Verify truss sits fully on bearing surface; no overhang or under-bearing
3. **Level Check:** Use level to verify truss web is plumb and bottom chord is level
4. **Fastening:** Install fasteners per **Truss Fastener Schedule**:
   - Typical bearing: 2 × 16d toe-nails or 3" connector nails per side
   - Install fasteners at slight angle for bearing connection (toe-nailing)
   - Do NOT fasten collar ties or lateral bracing yet
5. **Brace:** Install temporary diagonal bracing from truss to wall or floor (prevents tipping during installation)

#### Step 6: Install Remaining Trusses in Sequence
1. **Repeat for each truss** in sequence along building length:
   - Position on mark; verify bearing and alignment
   - Install fasteners per schedule
   - Install temporary bracing before removing installation crew
   
2. **Spacing Verification:** Spot-check minimum 3 locations for truss spacing accuracy (tolerance: ±½")
3. **Alignment Check:** Sight along truss tops (main chords) to verify no twists or misalignment (visual straightness; max deviation ±¼" over span)
4. **Identify Any Out-of-Spec Trusses:** If truss is visibly warped, split, or doesn't fit, red-tag and escalate before fastening

#### Step 7: Install Collar Ties (if Engineered)
1. **Collar tie function:** Prevent rafter separation and lateral thrust transfer
2. **Location:** Install per engineered plan (typically 4' below apex, 4' o.c. along roof length)
3. **Installation sequence:**
   - Cut collar ties to engineered length (includes 1"–2" lap for fastening)
   - Position at interior intersection of rafters or trusses
   - Fasten per schedule (typically 3 × 16d nails or equivalent per connection)
4. **Verify placement:** Check that no collar ties are missing or misplaced (visual sweep or diagram comparison)

#### Step 8: Install Lateral Bracing (if Engineered)
1. **Purpose:** Resist racking and wind loads; maintain truss geometry
2. **Types:** 1×4 or 2×4 diagonal bracing, vertical struts, or collar ties per design
3. **Installation:**
   - Install per spatial plan provided by engineer (may be on separate bracing diagram)
   - Fasten with fasteners per schedule (typically 3 nails per connection minimum)
   - Verify all connection points are secure before moving to next phase
4. **Inspection:** Confirm all bracing members are in place; photograph for record

### 7.4 Roof Sheathing Installation

#### Step 9: Prepare & Verify Sheathing Material
1. **Verify sheathing:** Grade stamp visible, OSB/plywood in good condition (no moisture staining, delamination, or warping)
2. **Acclimate material** if temperature <50°F or humidity >85% (wait 24 hours minimum before opening bundles)
3. **Check for defects:** No water damage, no edge damage, no softness or sponginess
4. **Layout planning:** Arrange sheathing to minimize waste and ensure staggered end joints (offset ≥4 feet between rows)

#### Step 10: Install Roof Sheathing
1. **Start from eave:** Begin sheathing installation at lowest point of roof
2. **Adhesive application:** Apply to all truss tops that will support sheathing:
   - Notched trowel (¼" × ⅜" notch) or continuous bead pattern
   - Ensure continuous adhesive with no voids or gaps between trusses
3. **Panel placement:** 
   - Lay sheathing perpendicular to trusses
   - Stagger end joints (at least 4' offset between rows)
   - Align first panel to eave edge (overhang per plan, typically 0"–2")
4. **Fastening pattern** (per **Roof Sheathing Schedule**):
   - **Perimeter:** 6" on center spacing
   - **Field (interior):** 12" on center in both directions
   - **Fastener type:** Ring-shank roofing nails (8d or 10d) or approved structural screws
   - **Penetration:** Fasteners must fully embed without crushing sheathing
5. **Squeeze-out check:** Adhesive should be visible (squeezed out) at ≥80% of truss intersections
6. **Continue layering:** Install successive courses until roof is fully sheathed
7. **Gable end sheathing:** Install on vertical gable ends; fasten to gable trusses and rim board

#### Step 11: Verify Sheathing Coverage & Fastening
1. **Self-check by crew:** Verify no shiners (missed fasteners); tap all fasteners for secure seating
2. **Check panel alignment:** No gaps between panels (≤⅛" expansion gap acceptable at perimeter)
3. **Verify panel overhangs:** Sheathing extends past end walls and eave line per plan detail
4. **Documentation:** Record sheathing installation date and any material deviations on daily log

#### Step 13: Install Roofing Felt or Synthetic Underlayment (Main Roof)
1. **Material choice:** 30# felt, synthetic wrap, or equivalent per plan specification
2. **Coverage:** Install over entire roof surface from eave line to ridge
3. **Installation:**
   - Unroll perpendicular to roof slope
   - Start at eave line and work upward (overlap each course ≥2–4 inches)
   - Align parallel to eave edge
   - Fasten with roofing staples or nails per schedule (typical: 4"–6" o.c. along eaves, 12" o.c. field)
4. **Wrapping details:**
   - Wrap ridge details (extend underlayment over ridge board if exposed)
   - Wrap gable edges and eaves (underlayment extends past edge ≥½ inch)
   - Tuck underlayment into gutters or extend past gutter if open edge design
5. **Penetration openings:** Wrap underlayment around all roof vent, chimney, and MEP penetrations (mark openings clearly for Phase-4 rough-in)

   - Install soffit vents at intervals per attic ventilation design (typically every 4–6 feet)
   - Verify vents are clear and not blocked; confirm attic exhaust path is unobstructed
4. **Trim connection:** Ensure soffit connects cleanly to fascia board and wall interface

#### Step 15: Install Fascia Board
1. **Purpose:** Finishing trim; nails and gutters attach to fascia
2. **Material:** 1×8 or 1×10 lumber (typically pine, cedar, or composite); profile and finish per plan
3. **Installation:**
   - Cut fascia to length; miter corners as required by design
   - Fasten to rafter tails or soffit support structure with fasteners per schedule (typically 16d nails every 16" o.c.)
   - Use shims if needed to ensure fascia is plumb and straight
   - Verify fascia alignment: visually straight along building length (sightline check)
   - Caulk and prime/paint per finish specification
4. **Gable end fascia:** Install on gable ends at appropriate height (typically top of wall below gable sheathing)

#### Step 16: Install Crown Molding & Detail Trim (if Engineered)
1. **Location:** At interface of fascia, soffit, and wall elevation per architectural detail
2. **Installation:**
   - Cut trim to fit at angles and transitions
   - Fasten with fasteners appropriate to trim type (typically finish nails or screws)
   - Ensure tight joints with caulk; prime and paint as required
3. **Verify finish:** All trim transitions are clean and aligned with elevation drawings

#### Step 17: Install Gutters & Downspouts
1. **Gutter type:** 5" or 6" K-style aluminum or copper; gauge per architectural spec
2. **Installation locations:**
   - Install along eave line at all roof-to-wall boundaries
   - Slope toward downspout locations (typical: ⅛"–¼" per 10 feet for drainage)
   - Ensure gutter is securely fastened to fascia board (hangers every 24" o.c., or per manufacturer)
3. **Fastening:**
   - Use appropriate fasteners for gutter material (galvanized or stainless for aluminum; copper fasteners for copper)
   - Ensure hangers are tight; gutters do not sag or pull away
4. **Downspout installation:**
   - Connect downspout outlets to gutter at lowest points
   - Downspouts route to grade or storm drain per landscaping/drainage plan
   - Fasten downspouts to wall or building with brackets every 4–6 feet
   - Ensure downspout outlet extends ≥4 feet from foundation
5. **Rough-in only:** If gutter finish/landscaping is Phase-5, rough-in attachment points and verify drainage slope only

### 7.7 Roof Vent & Penetration Rough-Outs

#### Step 18: Mark Roof Penetration Locations
1. **Identify all penetrations** from MEP rough-in plan and architectural drawings:
   - Plumbing vents (roof penetration locations)
   - HVAC exhaust/intake vents (specific locations per HVAC design)
   - Chimney chase (if applicable; verify structural blocking)
   - Skylights (if applicable; verify header sizing)
2. **Mark on sheathing:** Use marker or spray paint to identify penetration centerline locations
3. **Rough-out openings:** 
   - Do NOT cut final penetration openings yet (Phase-4 MEP responsibility)
   - Mark opening extents on sheathing with paint or tape
   - Notify MEP crew of rough-out locations before underlayment is fully sealed
4. **Document locations:** Photograph marked penetration locations for record; include in Phase-3 completion package

#### Step 19: Install Ridge Vent or Roof Venting (if applicable)
1. **Function:** Attic ventilation; allow hot/humid air to escape
2. **Type options:** Ridge vent (continuous 1" opening at ridge), roof vents (individual turbine or static vents), or soffit vents only (soffit-to-ridge path)
3. **Installation (if ridge vent):**
   - Cut ridge opening per vent manufacturer specifications (typically 1"–1½" wide along entire ridge)
   - Install vent filter and top cap per instructions
   - Fasten with fasteners per schedule (roofing screws or nails)
   - Seal seams with roofing sealant
4. **Installation (if individual roof vents):**
   - Mark locations per architectural or HVAC plan
   - Do NOT cut final penetrations yet; mark for Phase-4 MEP installation
   - Rough-in duct boots if delivered with trusses
