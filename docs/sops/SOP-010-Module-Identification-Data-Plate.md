## 1. Purpose

To establish procedures for assigning unique module identification numbers, managing module traceability throughout production, creating data plates with required information, installing plates correctly, and maintaining complete identification records for each module.

---

## 2. Scope

Applies to:
- Assignment of module serial numbers
- Traceability throughout production phases
- Data plate creation and specifications
- Module traveler initiation and tracking
- Customer identification documentation
- Module location and status tracking

---

## 3. References & Standards

- CDOH Data Plate Requirements
- HUD Code Section 3280.503
- IRC Chapter 5
- SOP-001 (Document Control)
- SOP-009 (Regulatory Compliance)

---

## 4. Module Serial Number System

### 4.1 Serial Number Format

```
FH-[YEAR]-[MONTH]-[DESIGN]-[SEQUENCE]

Example: FH-2026-01-D100-0047

Where:
FH = Fort and Homes LLC
2026 = Year
01 = Month
D100 = Design code (model)
0047 = Sequential number (1-9999)
```

### 4.2 Assignment Process

- Serial number assigned at production planning
- Documented in production schedule
- Marked on module traveler
- Linked to customer order
- Used throughout production tracking

---

## 5. Module Traveler Initiation

### 5.1 Traveler Document

**Created at start of production, contains:**
- Module serial number
- Customer name and order number
- Design specification and drawing reference
- Phase-by-phase sign-off
- Inspection and hold point records
- Material certifications
- Final inspection sign-off

### 5.2 Traveler Progression

The traveler follows module through all 8 phases:
1. ✓ Chassis & Floor (Phase 1)
2. ✓ Wall Framing (Phase 2)
3. ✓ Roof Framing (Phase 3)
4. ✓ MEP Rough-In (Phase 4)
5. ✓ Insulation (Phase 5)
6. ✓ Drywall (Phase 6)
7. ✓ Interior Finish (Phase 7)
8. ✓ Final Inspection (Phase 8)

## 6. Data Plate Creation

### 6.1 Required Information

**Data plate must include:**
- Manufacturer: FORT AND HOMES LLC
- Serial Number: FH-YYYY-MM-DESIGN-XXXX
- Model: Design designation
- Dimensions: Length x Width x Height
- Year Built: YYYY
- Certification: CDOH, HUD Code, ICC
- Installation Requirements: Brief summary
- Contact: Manufacturer phone/website

### 6.2 Data Plate Format

**Physical specifications:**
- Material: Aluminum or stainless steel (weatherproof)
- Size: Minimum 3" x 4"
- Lettering: Minimum ¼" height
- Finish: Durable (engraved or embossed)
- Attachment: Permanent (riveted or bolted)

### 6.3 Placement Requirements

- **Location:** Exterior-accessible location
- **Position:** Not covered by additions/awnings
- **Height:** Between 2-6 feet from ground (module level)
- **Visibility:** Clearly visible during inspection
- **Protection:** Weathertight, not subject to damage

---

## 7. Data Plate Installation

### 7.1 Installation Process

1. **Verify accuracy** of plate information before installation
2. **Select location** per requirements
3. **Clean surface** where plate will attach
4. **Attach securely** using rivets (not screws)
5. **Verify installation** per standards
6. **Document** with photograph
7. **Record in traveler**

### 7.2 Installation Verification

- ✓ Plate secured permanently
- ✓ All information clearly visible
- ✓ Serial number matches module traveler
- ✓ Photograph taken for records
- ✓ Supervisor sign-off on traveler

---

## 8. Module Tracking & Status

### 8.1 Status Tracking Throughout Production

| Phase | Status | Hold Point? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Phase 1 (Chassis) | In Progress → Hold Point 1 | Yes (HP-1) |
| Phase 2 (Wall Frame) | In Progress → Hold Point 2 | Yes (HP-2) |
| Phase 3 (Roof) | In Progress → Hold Point 3 | Yes (HP-3) |
| Phase 4 (MEP Rough) | In Progress → Hold Point 4 | Yes (HP-4) |
| Phase 5 (Insulation) | In Progress → In Progress | No |
| Phase 6 (Drywall) | In Progress → In Progress | No |
| Phase 7 (Interior) | In Progress → In Progress | No |
| Phase 8 (Final) | Final Inspection → Released | Yes (HP-8) |

### 8.2 Location Tracking

- Maintain log of module location
- Bay assignment per phase
- Supervisor responsible for section
- Date entered each phase
- Date exited/completed each phase

### 8.3 Traceability for Recalls

If recall issued:
- Identify all affected modules by serial number range
- Locate modules in field
- Contact customers
- Coordinate repair/replacement
- Document resolution

---
