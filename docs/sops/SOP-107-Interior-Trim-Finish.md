## 7. Detailed Procedure

### 7.1 Interior Door Frame & Door Installation

#### Step 1: Prepare Door Openings
1. Verify rough opening dimensions match plan (tolerance: ±¼")
2. Check that framing is square and plumb (use level on both vertical jambs)
3. If opening is out of plumb >¼", shim frame before installing door jamb
4. Confirm no drywall debris or obstructions in opening
5. Dry-fit pre-made door frame or build frame to height per plan

#### Step 2: Install Door Frame
1. **Position frame** in opening, ensuring equal reveals on both sides (typically 1/4"–1/2")
2. **Shim jambs** to plumb using wood shims; check with level (plumb tolerance: 1/8" per 80" height)
3. **Fasten frame** per schedule:
   - Nail through jamb into framing (16d nails, 3 per side minimum, staggered)
   - Or screw through jamb with 2.5" wood screws (2–3 per side)
4. **Verify head** is level (check with level across top of frame)
5. **Verify reveal** is consistent top to bottom
6. **Set sill** (for exterior-adjacent doors); slope for water drainage if applicable

#### Step 3: Install Door
1. **Remove door from packaging** and inspect for warping, finish damage
2. **Position hinges** per manufacturer standard (typically 2–2.5" from top and bottom; third hinge at midpoint for heavy doors)
3. **Mortise hinges** into door edge if not pre-cut:
   - Mark hinge positions
   - Cut mortises to depth of hinge plate
   - Install hinge pins
4. **Hang door** on frame:
   - Support door at sill with shims
   - Screw hinges to frame (not fully tight yet)
   - Check for binding or gaps
5. **Adjust** for even gap (typically 1/8" all around):
   - Loosen hinge screws if needed
   - Shim frame or door as needed
   - Re-tighten hinge screws
6. **Verify operation:** Door swings smoothly without binding; self-closes (if closer installed)

#### Step 4: Install Door Hardware
1. **Install lockset / lever set:**
   - Mark center point on door (typically 36–38" from floor)
   - Drill through-holes per manufacturer template
   - Install latch mechanism on edge
   - Install lever handles on both sides
   - Test smooth operation

### 7.2 Trim Installation (Baseboards, Crown, Casing)

#### Step 5: Install Door & Window Casings
1. **Prepare casing material:**
   - Cut to length (miter top corners at 45° if design calls for it, or butt-join per style)
   - Pre-sand and stain/paint if required (allows full finish coverage)
2. **Dry-fit** casings around door/window opening to verify fit and appearance
3. **Apply finish** (paint or stain) if not pre-finished; allow to cure per schedule before nailing
4. **Install casings:**
   - Apply brad nails or finish nails every 8–12" into door frame and wall framing
   - Use brad nailer (18 ga) for delicate wood; nail gun for thicker casings
   - Countersink nail heads slightly (nail punch if visible)
   - Fill nail holes with matching wood putty or filler
5. **Verify** casings are straight (use straightedge or sightline); no gaps at corners

#### Step 6: Install Baseboards
1. **Measure room perimeter** and cut baseboards:
   - Outside corners: miter at 45°
   - Inside corners: miter or cope-cut per style and crew skill
   - Butt-join at doorways and transitions
2. **Dry-fit** all baseboards before fastening
3. **Prepare baseboards** (sand, stain, paint if not pre-finished)
4. **Install baseboards:**
   - Apply construction adhesive to back (thin bead) for better glue-down
   - Nail every 12–16" into wall framing (locate studs with stud finder)
   - Use 16d finish nails (brad nailer acceptable for thinner stock)
   - Nail at angle to increase holding power
5. **Seal joints:**
   - Fill miter joints with matching caulk or filler for seamless appearance
   - Sand after curing
   - Apply finish coat if needed

#### Step 7: Install Crown Molding (if specified)
1. **Cut crown molding** to lengths (miter outside corners, cope-cut inside corners)
2. **Prepare** (sand, stain, paint if required before installation)
3. **Install crown:**
   - Locate top plate/wall-ceiling junction
   - Apply adhesive and nail crown every 12" into blocking or top plate
   - Use finish nails (16d) angled to prevent splitting
   - Install backer blocks if top plate is too soft for nail holding
4. **Seal corners** with caulk; sand and finish as needed

### 7.3 Interior Painting & Finishing

#### Step 8: Surface Preparation & Priming
1. **Inspect all surfaces:**
   - Drywall must be clean (dust removed, no joint compound residue)
   - Wood trim must be sanded smooth (150+ grit minimum)
   - Any stains or water marks: apply stain-blocking primer
2. **Mask areas** not to be painted:
   - Use painter's tape along trim/base lines
   - Cover flooring with drop cloths
   - Mask windows and hardware as needed
3. **Prime if required:**
   - Apply primer per finish schedule (required over fresh drywall, stains, or color changes)
   - Cut in with brush along trim and corners
   - Roll on primer to larger wall areas
   - Allow primer to cure per manufacturer (typically 2–4 hours)

#### Step 9: Apply Interior Paint
1. **Verify paint color:**
   - Compare test patch against finish schedule
   - Confirm color match with customer (if customer present)
   - Ensure tint code matches work order
2. **Cut in** paint (corners, trim lines, ceiling):
   - Use 2–3" brush
   - Apply thin, even coat
   - Avoid drips and excessive buildup
3. **Roll walls and ceiling:**
   - Use appropriate roller nap (lint-free preferred)
   - Apply even pressure; avoid over-rolling which causes stippling
   - Maintain "wet edge" to avoid lap marks
   - Typical coverage: 1–2 coats per paint specification
4. **Apply finish coats:**
   - Allow each coat to cure per paint schedule (typically 4–8 hours between coats)
   - Sand lightly between coats if recommended by paint manufacturer
   - Verify color uniformity and coverage (no holidays or thin spots)
5. **Final inspection:**
   - Check for drips, runs, or sags; correct while still wet
   - Verify color match across all walls and trim
   - Remove painter's tape while paint is still slightly tacky (prevents pulling off fresh paint)

#### Step 10: Stain & Finish Wood Surfaces
1. **If wood staining required:**
   - Select stain color per finish schedule
   - Test stain on concealed surface or scrap first
   - Apply stain per manufacturer instructions (brush or rag; grain-following direction)
   - Allow drying per schedule (typically 4–8 hours)
2. **Apply polyurethane or clear coat** (if wood is exposed):
   - Sand between coats (150+ grit) if multiple coats planned
   - Apply per manufacturer instructions (brush or spray)
   - Typical: 2 coats minimum for durability
3. **Verify finish:**
   - No dust or debris in finish
   - Color and gloss level match spec
   - Allow full cure before assembly or occupancy

### 7.4 Flooring Installation

#### Step 11: Prepare Flooring & Subfloor
1. **Acclimate flooring material:**
   - Hardwood/laminate: 48 hours minimum at room temperature (65–75°F) and 35–50% humidity
   - Verify moisture content of subfloor (≤12% for hardwood installations)
   - Moisture test: use pin-type moisture meter at multiple spots
2. **Prepare subfloor:**
   - Ensure subfloor is clean, dry, and level (max 3/8" variance over 10' per flooring standard)
   - Fill low spots or sand high spots as needed
   - Patch any gaps or damaged areas
3. **Verify room is ready:**
   - Walls painted and cured
   - Baseboard not yet installed (flooring installed first, baseboard covers top edge)
   - Room temperature/humidity controlled

#### Step 12: Install Flooring
1. **Establish layout:**
   - Snap chalk line parallel to longest wall (flooring layout line)
   - Verify first row is square to room (perpendicular to walls)
2. **For hardwood flooring:**
   - Apply underlayment or moisture barrier per manufacturer
   - Nail flooring to subfloor with flooring nailer (angled through tongue)
   - Stagger end joints; leave ¾" expansion gap at all walls
   - Place rows tightly together (no gaps between boards)
   - Verify no fasteners protrude; nail countersink required
3. **For laminate/vinyl flooring:**
   - Install underlayment per manufacturer (vapor barrier if required)
   - Use floating installation method (click-lock or glued):
     - Interlock planks perpendicular to subfloor framing
     - Maintain ¾" expansion gap at walls
     - Do NOT nail; allow natural movement
   - If glue-down required, apply per manufacturer adhesive schedule
4. **Final flooring checks:**
   - No visible gaps or buckling
   - No soft spots or movement when walked on
   - All fasteners fully seated (hardwood)
   - Flooring is level and adhered (laminate/vinyl)
