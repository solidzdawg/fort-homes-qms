# WI-103: Roof Framing (Phase 3) — CC21TE Update

**Source drawing:** Shop Drawings for CC21TE (SHOP FINAL)

Notes: This CC21TE variant highlights drawing callouts to be verified against the PDF and adds traceability placeholders (data/cc21te/traceability.md).

---

(Original WI content follows; CC21TE-specific callouts to confirm from PDF: truss spacing, bearing requirements, connector plate types, uplift/bracing details.)

```
```

(Refer to `../WI-103-Roof-Framing.md` for full step-by-step base instructions; replace the placeholder values with CC21TE PDF references.)

Deliverables (CC21TE):
- `wi-103-cc21te.md` (this file)
- Update `data/cc21te/traceability.md` with PDF page/figure references for truss tables and bracing.
