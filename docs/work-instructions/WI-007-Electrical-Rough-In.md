## 6. Procedure

### Step 1: Pre-Installation Verification
1.1. Verify Phase 3 (roof framing) complete and HP-3 approved (walls and roof structure in place)

1.2. Review electrical plan and load calculation:
   * Verify panel rating adequate for total load
   * Identify AFCI-required circuits (NEC 210.12): dwelling unit bedrooms, family rooms, living rooms, etc.
   * Identify GFCI-required circuits (NEC 210.8): bathrooms, kitchens within 6' of sink, outdoor, garage, crawlspace, unfinished basement
   * Note special requirements (isolated ground, dedicated circuits)

1.3. Coordinate with other trades:
   * Plumbing and HVAC rough-in to avoid conflicts
   * Identify locations where cables cross other trade penetrations

1.4. Check material delivery:
   * Verify all materials on job site
   * Inspect for damage (crushed boxes, torn cable jacket)
   * Verify wire gauge matches plan (check cable jacket printing)

**HOLD**: Do not proceed if plans unclear, materials missing, or licensing invalid

---

### Step 2: Install Service Panel / Subpanel
2.1. Mount panel enclosure:
   * Location per plan (typically utility room, garage, or near entry)
   * Height: Top of panel 6' - 6'6" above finished floor (NEC 110.26 working clearance)
   * Secure to wall framing (4 screws minimum, or per manufacturer instructions)
   * Ensure plumb and level

2.2. Verify working clearance (NEC 110.26):
   * Minimum 30" wide x 36" deep clear space in front of panel
   * No obstructions (plumbing, HVAC ducts, storage)
   * Panel door can open 90° minimum

2.3. Install main breaker or main lugs (if subpanel fed from exterior main service):
   * Main breaker rated per plan (100A, 150A, or 200A typical)
   * If subpanel: verify feeder cable size adequate for rating (10 AWG for 30A, 8 AWG for 40A, 6 AWG for 60A, etc. per NEC Table 310.16)

2.4. Verify panel grounding:
   * Main panel: Ground wire to grounding electrode system (ground rod, water pipe, UFER ground)
   * Subpanel: Ground and neutral separated (ground bus separate from neutral bus, per NEC 250.142)

2.5. Label panel exterior:
   * "ELECTRICAL PANEL - MAIN DISCONNECT" (if main service)
   * Panel schedule/directory (circuit numbers and descriptions) - will be filled during final trim

---

### Step 3: Rough-In Outlet and Switch Boxes
3.1. Mark box locations:
   * Outlets: Typically 12" - 18" above finished floor (AFF), verify plan for specific heights
   * Switches: Typically 48" AFF to center of switch, verify plan
   * Special outlets: Kitchen countertop (44" AFF), above bathroom vanity (varies), outdoor (check plan)
   * Required outlet spacing: Every 12' along walls, within 6' of doorways (NEC 210.52)

3.2. Install boxes:
   * **Mounting depth**: Box face should be flush with finished drywall surface
     * For 1/2" drywall: Box mounted 1/2" proud of framing
     * For 5/8" drywall: Box mounted 5/8" proud of framing
     * Use adjustable depth boxes or shim to achieve correct depth
   * **Fastening**: Nail-on boxes secured with integral nails, or screw boxes directly to stud
     * Box must be securely fastened per NEC 314.23 (will not move when device installed)
   * **Secure to stud/joist**: All boxes supported by framing (no free-hanging boxes)

3.3. Special box installation considerations:
   * **Back-to-back boxes** (outlets on opposite sides of same wall):
     * Offset horizontally by at least 6" to avoid compromising fire rating
     * Install horizontal fire blocking between boxes if required
   * **Ceiling boxes** (for lights, fans):
     * Fan-rated box required if ceiling fan possible (NEC 314.27)
     * Secure to joist or install fan-rated brace bar
     * Box must support minimum 50 lbs (fan-rated boxes support 70-150 lbs)
   * **Wet locations** (outdoor, shower):
     * Use weatherproof boxes (NEMA 3R or better) for outdoor
     * Use vapor-tight boxes for shower ceiling lights

3.4. Box fill calculation (NEC 314.16):
   * Calculate conductor count entering box
   * Verify box size adequate (box volume in cubic inches ≥ conductor fill)
   * Example: Single-gang outlet box (18 cu in) with 2 cables (2 hot, 2 neutral, 2 ground):
     * Count: 2 hots + 2 neutrals + 1 ground (all grounds count as one) + 1 device = 6 conductors
     * 14 AWG: 6 conductors x 2 cu in = 12 cu in required → 18 cu in box is adequate
     * If inadequate: Use larger box or reduce conductors

---

### Step 4: Run Branch Circuit Cables
4.1. Cable routing:
   * **Through studs/joists**: Drill holes centered in member, minimum 1-1/4" from edge (NEC 300.4)
     * If hole <1-1/4" from edge: Install steel nail plate to protect cable
   * **Along studs**: Secure cable with staples every 4.5' and within 12" of each box (NEC 334.30)
   * **Across joists** (attic/crawlspace): Secure cables to running boards or use cable tray
   * **Through top/bottom plates**: Drill holes and protect with nail plates

4.2. Cable support and protection:
   * Use cable staples (not damaged cable jacket)
   * Avoid sharp bends (minimum bend radius 5x cable diameter)
   * Protect cables from physical damage:
     * Nail plates where within 1-1/4" of framing edge
     * Nail plates on top plates (protect from drywall screws)
     * Conduit or guard strips if cable exposed in garage or mechanical room

4.3. Cable entry into boxes:
   * Remove knockout or use cable clamp connector
   * Secure cable to box with internal clamp or external connector
   * Leave 6" - 8" of cable extending into box (NEC 300.14 requires min 6" free conductor)
   * Remove cable jacket inside box (expose individual conductors)

4.4. Labeling:
   * Label each cable at panel end with circuit number (use tape or marker on cable jacket)
   * Label multi-gang boxes with circuit numbers (helps during troubleshooting)

---

### Step 5: Install Cables to Panel and Terminate
5.1. Route cables to panel:
   * Bundle cables neatly and secure (avoid spaghetti nest)
   * Enter panel through knockouts (top or bottom, per plan)
   * Secure cables within 12" of panel entry

5.2. Strip cable jackets:
   * Remove jacket inside panel (expose individual conductors)
   * Leave jacket extending 1/4" minimum into panel (NEC 334.15 requires protection at entry)

5.3. Terminate conductors:
   * **Hot (black/red) wires**: Connect to circuit breaker terminals
     * Strip insulation 3/4" (no more, no less)
     * Insert wire fully into breaker terminal
     * Tighten screw to manufacturer torque spec (typically 15-25 in-lbs, check breaker marking)
     * Verify wire secure (tug test - should not pull out)
   * **Neutral (white) wires**: Connect to neutral bus bar
     * One wire per terminal (do not double up unless bus rated for it)
     * Tighten terminal screw firmly
   * **Ground (bare/green) wires**: Connect to ground bus bar
     * Multiple grounds may share terminal if bus allows
     * Pigtail grounds if needed (splice grounds, one tail to bus)

5.4. Install circuit breakers in panel:
   * Snap breakers onto bus bars (verify seated fully)
   * Arrange breakers per panel schedule/circuit list
   * Balance loads across phases (even distribution of 120V circuits on opposite legs)
   * Label breaker positions (write circuit description on panel directory)

5.5. Torque verification:
   * Use torque screwdriver or torque wrench
   * Verify all panel terminations at proper torque per NEC 110.14(D)
   * Loose connections cause arcing and overheating (fire hazard)

### Step 6: AFCI and GFCI Installation
6.1. **AFCI Breakers** (Arc Fault Circuit Interrupter, NEC 210.12):
   * Required for: All 120V, 15A and 20A branch circuits in dwelling areas (bedrooms, living rooms, family rooms, dens, closets, hallways, etc.)
   * NOT required for: Bathrooms, garages, outdoor (but GFCI required instead)
   * Install AFCI breaker in panel (replaces standard breaker)
   * Connect neutral pigtail from AFCI breaker to neutral bus (AFCI breakers have neutral pigtail for arc detection)
   * Test AFCI: Press TEST button on breaker (should trip immediately), reset

6.2. **GFCI Protection** (Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter, NEC 210.8):
   * Required for: Bathrooms, kitchens within 6' of sink edge, outdoor receptacles, garages, crawlspaces, unfinished basements, laundry areas, wet bar sinks
   * **Method 1: GFCI Breaker** (protects entire circuit)
     * Install GFCI breaker in panel (has neutral pigtail like AFCI)
     * Connect neutral pigtail to neutral bus
     * Test: Press TEST button on breaker (should trip), reset
   * **Method 2: GFCI Receptacle** (protects downstream outlets on same circuit)
     * Install GFCI receptacle at first outlet in circuit (LINE side)
     * Connect downstream outlets to LOAD terminals on GFCI receptacle (if GFCI protection desired for those outlets)
     * Test: Press TEST button on receptacle (should trip), reset

6.3. Combination AFCI/GFCI:
   * Some circuits require BOTH protections (kitchen, laundry)
   * Use dual-function AFCI/GFCI breaker (meets both NEC 210.8 and 210.12)

---

### Step 7: Special Circuits and Dedicated Loads
7.1. **240V Circuits** (Range, Dryer, HVAC, Water Heater):
   * Use 2-pole breaker (both hot legs on breaker, neutral to neutral bus, ground to ground bus)
   * Wire sizing: #10 AWG for 30A (typical range/dryer), #12 AWG for 20A (typical AC), verify plan
   * Receptacle: NEMA 14-30R (range/dryer), or direct wire to equipment

7.2. **Dedicated Circuits** (required for certain appliances per NEC 210.52, 210.23):
   * Refrigerator: 20A circuit (optional but recommended)
   * Microwave: 20A circuit (if built-in)
   * Dishwasher: 20A circuit (dedicated or shared with disposal)
   * Garbage disposal: 20A circuit
   * Bathroom: 20A circuit (may serve multiple bathrooms if only receptacles on circuit)

7.3. **Smoke and CO Alarms** (NEC 210.12 and IRC R314):
   * Hard-wired with battery backup
   * Interconnected (all alarms in dwelling trigger together)
   * 3-wire cable between alarms (hot, neutral, interconnect wire)
   * Separate circuit or on lighting circuit (not on switched circuit)
   * Locations: Each bedroom, outside each sleeping area, each story including basement

7.4. **Outdoor and Weatherproof Circuits**:
   * GFCI protected (breaker or receptacle)
   * Weatherproof boxes and covers (in-use covers for wet locations)
   * Seal cable entry into box (prevent water intrusion)

---

### Step 8: Continuity Testing
8.1. **Visual Inspection** (before testing):
   * All cables secured and protected
   * All boxes secure and properly positioned
   * All panel terminations tight (torqued)
   * No damaged cable jackets or exposed conductors
   * All nail plates installed where required

8.2. **Continuity Testing** (circuit-by-circuit):
   * **DO NOT ENERGIZE** (testing with power OFF)
   * Use multimeter in continuity mode (or ohm meter)
   * At panel: Identify circuit conductors (hot, neutral, ground)
   * At outlet/switch box: Temporarily splice hot and neutral together (or hot and ground)
   * At panel: Test for continuity between corresponding conductors
   * Confirms: Correct conductor pairing, no open circuits (broken wires)
   * Record test results on Module Traveler checklist

8.3. **Short Circuit Testing**:
   * At panel: Verify NO continuity between hot and neutral (should be open circuit)
   * At panel: Verify NO continuity between hot and ground (should be open circuit)
   * Confirms: No short circuits (wires touching)
   * If short detected: Trace circuit and locate/repair short before proceeding

8.4. **Polarity Check** (if circuits energized for testing):
   * Use voltage tester or plug-in circuit analyzer at each receptacle
   * Verify: Hot on brass terminal (narrow slot), Neutral on silver terminal (wide slot), Ground on green terminal
   * Confirms: Correct wiring polarity (prevents shock hazard and equipment damage)

---

## 8. Common Errors to Avoid
* **Undersized wire for circuit**: Using 14 AWG on 20A circuit (must be 12 AWG). Check NEC Table 310.16.
* **Boxes too shallow/deep**: Box not flush with drywall = poor device installation. Check depth carefully.
* **Box overfill**: Too many wires in box violates NEC 314.16. Use larger box.
* **Loose panel terminations**: Causes arcing and overheating (fire hazard). Torque all connections.
* **Missing AFCI/GFCI**: Forgetting required protection per NEC 210.8/210.12. Review plan and NEC requirements.
* **Reversed polarity**: Hot and neutral swapped at receptacle (shock hazard). Test polarity before drywall.
* **Cable damage**: Staples driven into cable jacket, sharp bends, nail penetrations. Inspect all cables.
* **Missing nail plates**: Drywall screws can penetrate cables. Install plates on all at-risk cables.
* **Insufficient working clearance at panel**: Obstructions in front of panel violate NEC 110.26 (safety hazard).
* **Improper box securement**: Loose boxes will move when devices plugged/unplugged. Secure all boxes firmly to framing.

---

## 9. Hold Point HP-4 Preparation
