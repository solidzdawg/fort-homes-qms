## 1. Purpose
To provide step-by-step instructions for conducting pressure tests on water supply and drain-waste-vent (DWV) plumbing systems to verify system integrity before concealment, ensuring compliance with IRC and HP-4 inspection requirements.

## 2. Scope
Applies to all plumbing pressure tests at Fort Homes. Covers both water supply (potable water) and DWV (drainage) systems.

## 3. CRITICAL IMPORTANCE
⚠️ **CLOSED CONSTRUCTION**: This is the last inspection before insulation and drywall. Leaks discovered after concealment are extremely costly to repair (requires demolition and reconstruction). Pressure testing MUST be thorough and accurate.

## 4. Safety Requirements
* Wear safety glasses (pressurized systems can rupture and spray)
* Wear waterproof boots if testing with water method
* Ensure pressure gauges rated for test pressure (minimum 150 PSI for water, 15 PSI for air)
* Relief valve or bleed valve accessible during pressurization (emergency pressure release)
* Do not exceed rated pressure of weakest component (typically 100-150 PSI for PEX, CPVC)
* Ventilate area if using air test method (confined space considerations)
* **NEVER stand directly in front of plugs or caps during pressurization** (blow-out hazard)

## 5. Licensing Requirements
* Colorado-licensed Plumber (Journeyman or Master) must conduct or supervise testing
* License number recorded on Module Traveler

## 6. Testing Standards and Requirements

### 6.1 Water Supply System Test (IRC P2503.7)
* **Test Pressure**: 100 PSI (pounds per square inch)
* **Test Duration**: 15 minutes minimum
* **Pass Criteria**: No pressure drop (maximum 2 PSI drop acceptable per some jurisdictions, but Fort Homes standard is 0 PSI drop for PASS)
* **Method**: Hydrostatic (water) or pneumatic (air) pressure test

### 6.2 DWV System Test (IRC P2503.5, P2503.5.1)
* **Test Method 1 - Water (Hydrostatic)**:
  * **Test Pressure**: 10 feet of head (water column) = ~4.3 PSI
  * **Test Duration**: 15 minutes minimum
  * **Pass Criteria**: No visible leaks
* **Test Method 2 - Air (Pneumatic)**:
  * **Test Pressure**: 5 PSI (air pressure)
  * **Test Duration**: 15 minutes minimum
  * **Pass Criteria**: Maximum 1 PSI pressure drop per IRC P2503.5.1
* **Fort Homes Preferred**: Air test (cleaner, no water cleanup, faster, suitable for freezing weather)

## 7. Materials and Tools Required

### 7.1 Water Supply Test Equipment
* **Pressure gauge**: 0-200 PSI, calibrated (verify MTE label IN CALIBRATION)
* **Test pump**: Manual hand pump or air compressor with regulator
* **Hose and fittings**: Connect pump to water supply system
* **Plug or cap**: Close all open ends (fixtures not yet installed)
* **Pressure relief valve**: Safety release (set to ~120 PSI)
* **Bucket and rags**: For draining system after test

### 7.2 DWV Test Equipment
* **Pressure gauge**: 0-15 PSI, calibrated (verify MTE label)
* **Test plugs**: Inflatable rubber plugs for DWV pipe ends (various sizes: 2", 3", 4")
* **Air compressor with regulator**: Capable of delivering 5-10 PSI
* **Hose and fittings**: Connect compressor to DWV system
* **Soap solution or leak detector spray**: For finding leaks during air test

## 8. Procedure: Water Supply Pressure Test

### Step 1: Pre-Test Preparation
1.1. Verify water supply rough-in complete:
   * All pipes installed per plan
   * All joints soldered (copper), glued (CPVC), or crimped (PEX)
   * No open ends (all fixture connections capped or plugged)
   * Support and hangers installed per IRC P2605

1.2. Close all valves and shutoffs:
   * Main water shutoff valve closed (if present)
   * All fixture shutoffs closed (if installed at rough-in)
   * All appliance shutoffs closed

1.3. Install test gauge and pump:
   * Connect pressure gauge to accessible test port (typically hose bibb, laundry connection, or temporary test port)
   * Connect test pump (manual or air compressor with regulator)
   * Verify gauge reads ZERO before pressurizing

1.4. Visual inspection before test:
   * Look for obvious issues: loose fittings, incomplete joints, damaged pipes
   * Correct any obvious defects before pressurizing (prevents damage and saves time)

**HOLD**: Do not proceed if obvious defects present

---

### Step 2: Pressurize System
2.1. Begin pressurization slowly:
   * If using manual pump: Pump steadily, monitor gauge
   * If using air compressor: Set regulator to 100 PSI, open valve slowly
   * Pressurize to 100 PSI (no higher - risk of damaging components)

2.2. Monitor during pressurization:
   * Listen for hissing (air escaping) or spraying (water leaking)
   * Look for movement (pipes shifting, fittings separating)
   * If major leak detected: STOP pressurization immediately, release pressure, locate and repair leak

2.3. Reach and stabilize at 100 PSI:
   * Allow pressure to stabilize (10-30 seconds)
   * Close pump valve (isolate system from pump)
   * Verify gauge reads 100 PSI stable

---

### Step 3: Conduct 15-Minute Test
3.1. Start timer (15 minutes)

3.2. **Take initial photo** of gauge showing 100 PSI and time (timestamp on camera or include clock in photo)

3.3. Monitor system during test:
   * Visual inspection: Walk entire pipe run, look for leaks
   * Listen for hissing or dripping
   * Check all joints, fittings, connections, and caps
   * If leak found:
     * Note location
     * Do NOT stop test yet (continue to identify all leaks)
     * Mark leak location with tape or chalk

3.4. At 15 minutes:
   * **Take final photo** of gauge showing end pressure and time
   * Record end pressure on Module Traveler test log

---

### Step 4: Evaluate Results
4.1. **PASS Criteria**:
   * End pressure = 100 PSI (no drop) OR
   * End pressure ≥ 98 PSI (maximum 2 PSI drop, acceptable per some codes but Fort Homes targets 0 drop)
   * **No visible leaks**
   * **Action**: Record PASS on Module Traveler, proceed to Step 5 (depressurize and cleanup)

4.2. **FAIL Criteria**:
   * End pressure < 98 PSI (>2 PSI drop indicates leak)
   * Visible leaks identified during test
   * **Action**: Proceed to Step 6 (leak repair), then retest

---

### Step 5: Depressurize and Cleanup (After PASS)
5.1. Release pressure slowly:
   * Open bleed valve or test port
   * Allow air (or water) to escape gradually
   * Monitor gauge drop to ZERO

5.2. Remove test equipment:
   * Disconnect gauge and pump
   * Remove temporary plugs or caps (if fixture connections to be left open until trim-out)
   * OR leave caps in place if protecting from debris during construction

5.3. Document:
   * Module Traveler: Water Supply Pressure Test = PASS, 100 PSI start, 100 PSI end (or 98+ PSI), 15 minutes
   * Attach photos (start and end gauge readings)
   * Plumber signs and dates test section

---

### Step 6: Leak Repair and Retest (If FAIL)
6.1. Depressurize system completely (per Step 5.1)

6.2. Locate leaks:
   * Marked during test, OR
   * Conduct slower pressurization while watching all joints

6.3. Repair leaks:
   * **Copper solder joints**: Drain and dry joint, reflow solder, or cut and re-solder
   * **CPVC glued joints**: Cut out joint, install new fitting and pipe, re-glue
   * **PEX crimped joints**: Cut out fitting, install new fitting, re-crimp with proper tool and ring
   * **Threaded fittings**: Tighten, or disassemble, re-tape (Teflon or pipe dope), reassemble
   * **Damaged pipe**: Cut out damaged section, install new pipe and couplings

6.4. Allow repair to cure:
   * Soldered joints: Cool to touch before re-test (5-10 minutes)
   * Glued joints: Follow manufacturer cure time (CPVC: typically 15 minutes for 1/2"-1", 30 minutes for 1-1/2"+)
   * Crimped joints: Immediate (no cure time)

6.5. **Retest**: Repeat Steps 2-4 until system PASSES

   * **Vent stack top** (roof penetration or temporary cap): Install cap or plug
   * **All branch drains**: Verify plugged (no open toilets, showers, sinks yet)

9.3. Inflate test plugs:
   * Inflatable plugs: Use hand pump or air compressor to inflate per manufacturer instructions (typically 20-30 PSI in plug, NOT in pipe)
   * Verify plugs seated and not leaking around edges

9.4. Install test gauge and air source:
   * Connect pressure gauge (0-15 PSI, calibrated) to accessible test port (cleanout, vent stack, or temporary test port)
   * Connect air compressor with regulator to same port
   * Verify gauge reads ZERO before pressurizing

---

### Step 2: Pressurize DWV System to 5 PSI
9.2.1. Set air compressor regulator to 5 PSI

9.2.2. Open valve slowly, allow system to fill with air

9.2.3. Monitor gauge: When gauge reaches 5 PSI, close valve (isolate system from compressor)

9.2.4. Allow pressure to stabilize (30 seconds to 1 minute)
   * Pressure may drop initially as air fills entire system (normal)
   * Re-pressurize to 5 PSI if needed after stabilization

---

### Step 3: Conduct 15-Minute Test
9.3.1. Start timer (15 minutes)

9.3.2. **Take initial photo** of gauge showing 5 PSI and time

9.3.3. Monitor system during test:
   * **Apply soap solution or leak detector spray** to all joints, fittings, and connections

---

## 10. Procedure: DWV System Water Test (Alternative Method)
*Use if air test equipment not available, or if inspector prefers water test*

### Step 1: Pre-Test Preparation
10.1.1. Verify DWV rough-in complete (same as Step 9.1)

10.1.2. Plug all drain outlets (main drain, branch drains)

10.1.3. Cap vent stack top (roof penetration or temporary standpipe)

---

### Step 2: Fill System with Water
10.2.1. Fill system through vent stack or cleanout:
   * Use hose to introduce water into DWV system
   * Fill slowly to avoid trapping air pockets

10.2.2. Fill until water reaches 10 feet above lowest fixture drain:
   * **Example**: If lowest drain is at 2' above floor, fill vent stack to 12' above floor
   * **Typical**: Vent stack on roof of single-story module = ~12' head automatically

10.2.3. Top off as needed (water level may drop as system fills)

---

### Step 3: Conduct 15-Minute Test
10.3.1. Start timer (15 minutes)

10.3.2. Mark initial water level (chalk or tape on vent stack or standpipe)

10.3.3. Monitor system:
   * Visual inspection of all joints for leaks (water dripping or seeping)
   * Monitor water level in vent stack (should remain constant)

10.3.4. At 15 minutes:
   * Check water level (should not have dropped)
   * Check all joints for wetness

---

### Step 4: Evaluate Results
10.4.1. **PASS Criteria**:
   * No visible leaks
   * Water level unchanged (or <1" drop acceptable for evaporation)
   * **Action**: Record PASS, drain system

10.4.2. **FAIL Criteria**:
   * Visible leaks
   * Water level dropped significantly (indicates leak)
   * **Action**: Drain system, repair leaks, retest

---

### Step 5: Drain System
10.5.1. Remove main drain plug (lowest point)

10.5.2. Allow water to drain completely (may take 10-30 minutes)

10.5.3. Use shop vac or sponge to remove remaining water from traps if needed

10.5.4. Document results on Module Traveler

## 12. Common Errors to Avoid
* **Insufficient test pressure**: Using 50 PSI instead of 100 PSI won't detect all leaks. Must test at specified pressure.
* **Test duration too short**: 5-minute test insufficient. IRC requires 15 minutes minimum.
* **Uncalibrated gauge**: Inaccurate gauge gives false results. Always verify calibration label.
* **Missing leaks during visual inspection**: Small leaks can be hard to see. Use soap solution on DWV air tests.
* **Not allowing glue to cure**: Re-testing before glue cured will fail again. Follow cure times.
* **Damaged test plugs**: Worn or incorrect size plugs leak around edges. Use proper plugs and inflate correctly.
* **Ignoring small pressure drops**: Even 3-4 PSI drop indicates leak. Do not accept marginal results.
* **Poor photo documentation**: Blurry or unreadable gauge photos won't satisfy inspector. Take clear, well-lit photos.

---

## 13. HP-4 Requirements
**CRITICAL**: Both water supply and DWV tests must PASS before requesting HP-4 inspection.

**HP-4 Inspection Includes**:
* QA Manager verifies test results (reviews photos, checks gauge, witnesses retest if requested)
* **TPIA Inspector** reviews test results and may witness or require retest
* Both sign HP-4 section on Module Traveler

**If Tests FAIL at HP-4**:
* NCR issued (Red Tag)
* Plumber repairs leaks
* Retests conducted and documented
* Re-inspection before releasing to Phase 5 (insulation)
