## 1. Purpose
To provide step-by-step instructions for assembling the floor joist system (chassis/rim joists/floor joists) to ensure dimensional accuracy, structural integrity, and compliance with engineered plans.

## 2. Scope
Applies to all floor systems constructed at Fort Homes, all models (Aspen Commons, Melrose, Summit, Grand).

## 3. Safety Requirements
* Wear safety glasses at all times
* Wear steel-toe boots
* Use hearing protection when operating pneumatic tools
* Keep work area clear of trip hazards
* Use proper lifting techniques (bend knees, not back) or mechanical assist for heavy materials
* Ensure air hose connections secure before pressurizing
* Never place hands near nail gun discharge point

## 4. Materials and Tools Required

### 4.1 Materials (Verify Against Engineering Plans)
* **Rim joists**: Dimensional lumber (2x10, 2x12, or engineered lumber per plan), grade-stamped #2 or better
* **Floor joists**: Dimensional lumber or I-joists per plan, spaced per plan (typically 16" or 24" OC)
* **Blocking/Bridging**: If specified on plan
* **Fasteners**:
  * Rim joist to sill plate: 16d nails or structural screws per plan
  * Joist to rim/header: Joist hangers (Simpson or equivalent, ICC-ES listed) with specified fasteners, OR toe-nail per IRC Table R602.3(1)
* **Structural steel chassis** (if applicable to model): Per plan, with mill certifications

### 4.2 Tools
* Tape measure (25', 100'), CALIBRATED (verify green label MTE-### IN CALIBRATION)
* Framing square or speed square
* Chalk line
* Pencil or lumber crayon
* Pneumatic framing nailer (check air pressure 90-120 PSI)
* Hammer
* Level (4' or 6')
* Power saw (circular saw or chop saw) for cuts
* Drill/driver for structural screws or joist hanger nails

### 4.3 Engineering Plans
* Verify current revision stamped by PE (Professional Engineer)
* Plans show: Overall dimensions, joist size, joist spacing, joist direction, cantilever details (if any), bearing points

## 5. Procedure

### Step 1: Verify Bay Setup and Materials
1.1. Confirm Module Serial Number assigned to bay (check Module Traveler)

1.2. Verify engineering plan set matches serial number and model

1.3. Lay out materials in bay:
   * Rim joists near perimeter
   * Floor joists stacked and accessible
   * Fasteners and hangers in bins/buckets

1.4. Inspect materials for damage:
   * No splits, excessive warp, or water damage
   * Grade stamps legible on lumber
   * If any material defective: Set aside, notify Bay Supervisor, initiate Material NCR if needed

1.5. Verify material certifications on file (Bay Supervisor responsibility, but crew should confirm lumber is grade-stamped)

**HOLD**: Do not proceed if plans missing, materials damaged, or certifications absent

### Step 2: Layout Rim Joist Frame
2.1. Identify sill plate or steel chassis perimeter (if steel chassis, skip to Step 2.3 for attachment)

2.2. Cut rim joists to length per plan:
   * Front and rear rim joists: Length = overall module width per plan
   * Side rim joists: Length = overall module depth per plan - (2 x rim joist thickness)
   * Example: Module 40' x 12', using 2x10 rim (1.5" actual thickness):
     * Front/Rear: 144" (12')
     * Sides: 480" - 3" = 477" (40' minus 3" for overlapping front/rear rims)

2.3. Assemble rim joist rectangle on flat surface or jig:
   * Butt side rims to inside face of front/rear rims (NOT lapped at corners, unless plan specifies)
   * Fasten corners: 3x 16d nails per corner, OR structural screws per plan

2.4. Check for square:
   * Measure diagonals corner-to-corner
   * **Tolerance**: Diagonals must be within 1/4" of each other
   * Example: If diagonal A = 41' 2", diagonal B must be 41' 1-3/4" to 41' 2-1/4"
   * If out-of-square: Adjust by pushing/pulling corners, re-check diagonals

2.5. Verify overall dimensions:
   * Measure length and width of rim frame
   * **Tolerance**: ±1/8" of plan dimensions
   * If out-of-tolerance: Adjust cuts or re-measure plan dimensions

2.6. Mark diagonal measurements on Module Traveler checklist (HP-1 inspection will verify)

**CHECKPOINT**: Bay Supervisor verifies squaring before proceeding

### Step 3: Install Floor Joists
3.1. Mark joist layout on rim joists:
   * Starting point: Per plan (typically 15-1/4" OC from end for 16" OC spacing, or 23-1/4" for 24" OC)
   * Use chalk line to snap lines across rim joists at each joist location
   * Mark with "X" on side of line where joist will sit

3.2. Install first joist:
   * Position joist at first layout mark
   * Verify joist crown UP (sight down edge, hump should point up)
   * If using joist hangers:
     * Install hangers on rim joist faces using specified fasteners (typically 10d x 1-1/2" joist hanger nails)
     * Fill all nail holes in hanger (no skipping holes)
     * Place joist in hanger, nail through hanger into joist (fill all holes)
   * If toe-nailing (only if plan does not require hangers):
     * Toe-nail joist to rim with 3x 8d nails per IRC (2 on one side, 1 on opposite)
     * Drive nails at 30-45° angle

3.3. Continue installing joists at each layout mark:
   * Maintain consistent spacing (verify with tape measure every 5th joist)
   * All crowns facing same direction (up)

3.4. Install blocking or bridging (if specified on plan):
   * Solid blocking: Cut blocks from joist material, install at mid-span or per plan
   * Cross-bracing: Install metal cross-braces per manufacturer instructions

3.5. Verify joist spacing final check:
   * Measure from first joist to last joist, divide by number of spaces
   * Should equal plan spacing (16" or 24" OC) within ±1/4"

**CHECKPOINT**: Bay Supervisor inspects joist installation before decking

---

### Step 4: Special Details (If Applicable)
4.1. **Cantilevers** (if plan shows overhangs):
   * Extend joists beyond rim per plan dimension
   * Install blocking at cantilever end per plan
   * Verify cantilever length with tape measure (±1/4")

4.2. **Openings** (stairs, HVAC chases, plumbing penetrations):
   * Frame per plan: Double or triple joists at openings, headers as specified
   * Use joist hangers for headers
   * Do NOT cut joists without verifying plan details

4.3. **Bearing points** (if plan shows intermediate beams or walls):
   * Install beam or bearing wall per plan before continuing
   * Joists must bear minimum 1-1/2" on bearing surface per IRC

---

### Step 5: Final Inspection Before Decking
5.1. Walk the frame:
   * Check all joists seated properly in hangers or rim connections
   * Look for loose or missed nails
   * Verify no joists twisted or out-of-plane

5.2. Re-check squareness:
   * Measure diagonals again (frame can shift during joist installation)
   * Adjust if needed (within 1/4" tolerance)

5.3. Clean work area:
   * Remove scrap lumber, loose fasteners, sawdust
   * Prepare for adhesive and decking application (next step: WI-002)

5.4. Notify Bay Supervisor: Frame ready for inspection and decking

## 6. Quality Checkpoints

| Checkpoint | Specification | Verification Method | Pass/Fail |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Overall dimensions | Per plan ±1/8" | Tape measure | [ ] |
| Squareness (diagonals) | Within 1/4" of each other | Tape measure (both diagonals) | [ ] |
| Joist spacing | Per plan (16" or 24" OC) ±1/4" per joist | Tape measure | [ ] |
| Joist crown orientation | All crowns UP | Visual sighting | [ ] |
| Joist hangers | All nail holes filled | Visual inspection | [ ] |
| Fastener pattern | Per plan or IRC Table R602.3(1) | Count fasteners at sample joints | [ ] |
| Blocking/bridging | Per plan | Visual verification | [ ] |

**All checkpoints must PASS before proceeding to WI-002 (Subfloor Installation)**

## 7. Common Errors to Avoid
* **Reversed joist crown**: Joist installed with crown down causes bounce/sag in floor. ALWAYS crown up.
* **Skipped hanger nails**: Missing nails in joist hangers reduce strength. Fill ALL holes.
* **Out-of-square frame**: Causes problems throughout entire module (walls, roof won't fit). Check diagonals early and often.
* **Wrong joist spacing**: Using 16" OC when plan calls for 24" (or vice versa) affects structural capacity. Verify plan.
* **Cutting joists without authorization**: Never field-modify joists without Bay Supervisor and engineering approval.
