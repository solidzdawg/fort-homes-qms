# WI-104: MEP Rough-In (Phase 4) — CC21TE Update

**Source drawing:** Shop Drawings for CC21TE (SHOP FINAL)

Notes: CC21TE shop drawings likely contain specific conduit routes, penetration locations through floor/ceiling, and panel locations. Confirm all distances and clearances from PDF.

---

(Original WI content is the base; CC21TE-specific callouts to confirm from PDF: panel location offsets, conduit routing at bay seams, mechanical chase positions, required slopes for drains, gas line routing and materials.)

Refer to `../WI-104-MEP-Rough-In.md` and update the numeric callouts from `data/cc21te/cc21te-tasks.json` and `data/cc21te/traceability.md`.

Deliverables (CC21TE):
- Update `data/cc21te/traceability.md` with PDF page locations for electrical & plumbing layout.
- Produce `mep-stubout-photo-log.md` with CC21TE tag references.
