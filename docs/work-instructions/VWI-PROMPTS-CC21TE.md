## 📋 Image Generation Checklist

Use this checklist when generating images for a new Work Instruction:

- [ ] **Phase Overview Images** (1-2 per phase showing completed work)
- [ ] **Step Header Images** (1 per major step showing transformation)
- [ ] **Sub-Step Action Images** (1-3 per sub-step showing hand actions)
- [ ] **Detail/Macro Images** (as needed for critical tolerances)
- [ ] **Verification Images** (showing measurement/inspection tools in use)
- [ ] **Defect Reference Images** (correct vs incorrect comparisons)
- [ ] **Safety Callout Images** (PPE, hazards, warnings)
- [ ] **Tool/Material Reference Images** (what to gather before starting)
