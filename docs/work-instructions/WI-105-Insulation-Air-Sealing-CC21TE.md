# WI-105: Insulation & Air Sealing (Phase 5) — CC21TE Update

**Source drawing:** Shop Drawings for CC21TE (SHOP FINAL)

Notes: CC21TE drawings may specify thermal break locations, penetration schedules for insulation, and blower-door target infiltration. Confirm R-values, cavity depths, and blower door targets from PDF.

---

(Original WI content should be used as base; CC21TE-specific callouts to confirm: insulation thicknesses, required R-values, air barrier continuity details, blower-door target CFM50.)

Deliverables (CC21TE):
- Update `data/cc21te/traceability.md` with page references for insulation schedule and air-sealing diagrams.
- Produce `insulation-checklist-cc21te.md` with CC21TE-specific values.
