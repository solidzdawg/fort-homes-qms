## Section 1: Receiving & Positioning the Chassis

### Step 1.1: Inspect Chassis Frame Upon Delivery

**What to Do:**
1. Park delivery truck and position crane or forklift
2. Walk around entire frame; look for **visible cracks, dents, bent webs, or rust scale**
3. Check all corners and splice points — photo-document any damage
4. Verify **model number and VIN** match the work order

**Visual Checkpoints:**
- [ ] No cracks in webs or flanges
- [ ] Welds appear solid (no voids or spatter buildup)
- [ ] Steel color uniform (no severe rust or discoloration)
- [ ] All mounting pads present and intact
- [ ] Axles / support feet secure

**If Damage Found:** Flag with **RED TAG**, notify Bay Supervisor; do NOT proceed until approved.

        │  Leveling Blocks / Shims            │
        └─────────────────────────────────────┘

    MEASURE DIAGONALS:
    Corner A ──────────────────────── Corner C
    (measure tape along frame rails)
    
    Corner B ──────────────────────── Corner D
    
    Diagonal A-C: _____ inches
    Diagonal B-D: _____ inches
    DIFFERENCE:   _____ inches    (MUST be ≤ ¼")
```

**What to Do:**
1. Use forklift or crane to lift chassis safely (lift pads on chassis; do NOT lift by channels)
2. Place leveling blocks under frame support points (one at each corner minimum)
3. Lower chassis gently onto blocks; ensure even contact (no rocking)
4. Measure and record **diagonals** from corner to corner
   - Use steel tape; hold taut between measuring points
   - If diagonal difference **> ¼"**, shim frame until square
5. Use **laser level or transit** to verify top of frame is level (tolerance: ±¼" across length)

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Chassis resting evenly on leveling blocks (no gaps)
- [ ] Diagonals verified square (difference ≤ ¼")
- [ ] Top of frame level (±¼")
- [ ] Bay floor clean of debris around chassis

---

## Section 2: Layout & Joist Preparation

### Step 2.1: Mark Joist Layout

**What to Use:**
- Engineered plan (keep on-site, visible to crew)
- Chalk line (blue or red)
- Tape measure (25 feet)
- Pencil (soft lead for visible marks on metal frame)

**What to Do:**
1. **Review the plan** — identify joist size, spacing (e.g., "16" o.c." or "24" o.c."), and rim board details
2. **Mark layout** on top of rim board (or chassis top, if no rim board yet):
   - Start from one corner
   - Mark first joist at *measured distance* from corner (per plan, typically 12" or 16")
   - Mark every joist location with **X** (on joist side) and O (on opposite side)
   - Snap chalk line at each location for visibility

**Example Layout (16" o.c., starting 12" from corner):**

```
CORNER         12"        28"        44"        60"        76"        92"
  |            |          |          |          |          |          |
  O    X       O    X     O    X     O    X     O    X     O    X     O
  ├────────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────┤
  
  ← 16" →      ← 16" →    ← 16" →    ← 16" →    ← 16" →    ← 16" →

  X = joist location on this side of line
  O = joist location on opposite side of line
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Layout lines are chalk or pencil (not pen; pen washes off)
- [ ] Measurements verified with tape (no guessing)
- [ ] All lines clearly visible and labeled with joist number if helpful

---

### Step 2.2: Prepare & Cut Materials

**Joist Preparation:**

1. **Inspect each I-joist or dimensional lumber:**
   - Look for **splits, cracks, warping, or water staining**
   - Check **grade stamp** is visible and legible
   - Verify **moisture content** is ≤ 18% (ideally use moisture meter)

2. **Cut joists to length:**
   - Measure distance between rim boards (or chassis reference points)
   - Cut with circular saw or miter saw; verify **perpendicular cuts** (use square)
   - Notches for carriers/bracing **per plan only** — do NOT improvise

3. **Stage joists** in bay in order (stack near installation point if possible)

**Material Verification Checklist:**
- [ ] Grade stamps visible and match plan spec
- [ ] No visible defects (splits, twists, water damage)
- [ ] Cuts perpendicular; match measured dimensions
- [ ] Adhesive mixed and at room temperature (50°F+ recommended)

## Section 3: Rim Board & Joist Installation

### Step 3.1: Install Rim Boards

**Setup Diagram:**

```
                     CHASSIS FRAME (top view)
    
    ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐

    │ ├─ Fasteners: 16d nails @ 12" o.c.           │
    │ ├─ Seated firmly on chassis frame            │
    │ └─ Flush on all edges                        │
    │                                              │
    │  ┌────┐  ┌────┐  ┌────┐  ┌────┐             │
    │  │ J1 │  │ J2 │  │ J3 │  │ J4 │  (Joists)  │

    └──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**What to Do:**
1. **Apply adhesive** to top of chassis frame where rim board will sit:
   - Use ¼" notched trowel or adhesive bead (¼" diameter)
   - Cover full perimeter; ensure no gaps or voids
   - Adhesive should be tacky but not dried

2. **Set rim board** on adhesive:
   - Align flush with outer edge of chassis
   - Ensure perpendicular to direction of joists (check with speed square)
   - Press down firmly; slight squeeze-out should be visible

3. **Fasten rim board** per **Fastener Schedule**:
   - Typical: 16d ring-shank nails, 12" on center
   - Drive nails at slight angle (10–15° toe-nail) for better holding
   - Nails must seat fully without crushing rim board edge
   - **Listen for the pneumatic gun:** Proper pressure = solid "thunk" sound

4. **Install corner blocks** (if per plan):
   - Blocks tie perpendicular rim boards together
   - Fasten per schedule (typically 2 nails per end)

**Verification:**
- [ ] Adhesive squeeze-out visible along full length
- [ ] Rim board flush and plumb (check with level)
- [ ] All fasteners seated flush (tap with nail set if needed)
- [ ] No gaps between rim board and chassis

---

### Step 3.2: Install Joists (I-Joist Method)

**What to Do:**
1. **Apply adhesive** to joist bearing point on chassis/rim board:
   - ¼" bead, continuous contact surface
   - Adhesive on **top of chassis frame** AND **top of rim board** where joist will sit

2. **Position first joist:**
   - Lift joist carefully (use two people for longer spans)
   - Align with chalk line marking (use carpenter's level on flange to verify vertical)
   - Ensure **crown is up** (slight curve to top of joist)
   - Set firmly onto adhesive bed

3. **Fasten joist** per **Fastener Schedule**:
   - Typical: 3 × 16d nails per rim board connection
   - Fasteners through rim into joist flange (usually two nails per side of flange)
   - **Drive nails perpendicular to joist face** (not at angle; respect material orientation)
   - Verify penetration depth (nail should fully seat in rim; check from opposite side)

4. **Repeat** for all remaining joists:
   - Check spacing against chalk marks (tolerance: ±½")
   - Verify level and plumb every 3–4 joists
   - Ensure all adhesive is squeezed out before it hardens

**Verification Checklist (every 3 joists):**
- [ ] Joist is plumb (check with level on flange)
- [ ] Spacing matches chalk mark (±½")
- [ ] Adhesive squeeze-out visible on both sides
- [ ] Fasteners seated flush; no gaps or seating issues
- [ ] Joist crown is upward (sag should never occur)

### Step 3.3: Install Blocking & Bridging

**Blocking (horizontal members between joists):**

```
           ┌────────────────────┐
           │ I-JOIST 1          │
           │                    │

    │      │    BLOCK           │      │  (cuts between joists)
    │      │                    │      │
    └──────┼────────────────────┼──────┘
           │                    │
           │ I-JOIST 2          │
           └────────────────────┘
```

**What to Do:**
1. Measure distance between adjacent joists (inside face to inside face)
2. Cut blocking (typically 2×6 or 2×8) to length **slightly longer than measured distance**
3. Install blocking at mid-span (or per plan locations):
   - Push block between joists with slight force (snug fit)
   - Fasten per **Fastener Schedule** (typically 2 nails per end = 4 nails total)
   - Tap with hammer to ensure full seating

4. **Bridging** (if required by plan):
   - Cross-X or vertical pattern of smaller members
   - Install per engineered detail
   - Fasten at top and bottom to both joists

## Section 4: Subfloor Sheathing Installation

### Step 4.1: Prepare Sheathing

**What to Do:**
1. **Inspect panels:**
   - Check grade stamp (OSB or plywood; thickness per plan, typically ¾" T&G)
   - Ensure panels are **dry** (no water staining, swelling, or discoloration)
   - Stack panels flat (do NOT stand on edge; prevents warping)

2. **Plan layout:**
   - Arrange panels perpendicular to joists
   - Stagger end joints (no continuous lines; offset at least 16")
   - Leave **⅛" expansion gap** at all perimeter edges (use spacer block)

**Layout Diagram (top view):**

```
        ┌───────────┬───────────┐
        │ PANEL 1   │ PANEL 2   │  ← End joints STAGGERED

```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Panels flat and dry
- [ ] Grade stamp visible and legible
- [ ] Layout plan marked with chalk (joist line positions)
- [ ] Expansion gap spacers ready (⅛" shim stock)

---

### Step 4.2: Glue Joists & Install First Panel

**Adhesive Application:**

```
        TOP OF JOIST
             ↓
    ┌────────────────────┐
    │ Adhesive bead:     │
    │ ¼" × ⅜" notched    │
    │ trowel application │
    │                    │
    │ Or continuous      │
    │ serpentine bead    │
    │ (rope pattern)     │
    │                    │
    └────────────────────┘
```

**What to Do:**
1. **Apply adhesive** to ALL joist tops that support the panel:
   - Use ¼" × ⅜" notched trowel (draws adhesive in beads)
   - Or apply continuous bead with caulk gun (⅜" diameter rope)
   - Ensure **no voids or gaps** in the bead; full coverage of joist width
   - Adhesive temperature should be 50°F+ (check bottle)

2. **Position panel:**
   - First panel should be aligned flush with one end of subfloor
   - Leave ⅛" gap at rim board edge (use spacer)
   - Two people to position panel (heavy and unwieldy)

3. **Press panel firmly:**
   - Push down on panel surface while walking across it
   - Force should be distributed; press over each joist location
   - **Squeeze-out** of adhesive should be visible along joist lines
   - Slight resistance as you walk (adhesive bond working)

---

### Step 4.3: Fasten Subfloor Panel

**Fastener Pattern (per typical schedule):**

```
         PANEL (top-down view)
    
    EDGE OF PANEL
         ↓
    ├─○──○──○──○──○──○─┤  ← 6" on center (edges)
    │ ●   ●   ●   ●   │
    │ ●   ●   ●   ●   │  ← 12" o.c. field pattern
    │ ●   ●   ●   ●   │
    │ ●   ●   ●   ●   │
    ├─○──○──○──○──○──○─┤  ← 6" on center (edges)
         
    ○ = Edge fasteners (6" o.c., perpendicular to joists)
    ● = Field fasteners (12" o.c., both directions)
    
    FASTENER SPEC: 8d ring-shank nails (or per schedule)
    PENETRATION: Fully seated, no crushing
    NO SHINERS: Every nail must hit a joist
```

**What to Do:**
1. **Chalk line joist locations** on top of panel (before fastening):
   - Use chalk line snapped perpendicular to joists
   - Helps crew see where to drive fasteners
   - Keeps nails straight and prevents shiners

2. **Start fastening** at one corner:
   - Begin at **edge** (6" spacing perpendicular to joists)
   - Drive fasteners perpendicular to panel face (straight in, no angle)
   - Space 6" on center along all panel edges
   - Use **nail gun** with pressure set to 100–120 psi (test on scrap first)

3. **Complete field fastening** (12" o.c. interior):
   - Drive fasteners in grid pattern across panel
   - Every fastener must hit a joist
   - **Listen & feel:** Proper seating sounds like solid "thunk"; incorrect seating sounds hollow or has rebound
   - If fastener pops or fastener head crushes panel edge, STOP — reduce gun pressure

4. **Verify fastening:**
   - Walk along each joist line; tap fasteners with hammer handle
   - All should sound solid (no hollow sound = shiner or void)
   - No fastener pops or surface irregularities
   - Compare pattern to fastener schedule photo

**Fastening Diagram (elevation view, one joist):**

```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] All edge fasteners driven (6" spacing)
- [ ] All field fasteners driven (12" spacing)
- [ ] No shiners (every nail hits a joist)
- [ ] No pops or unseated fasteners
- [ ] Fastener pattern matches schedule

---

### Step 4.4: Install Remaining Panels

**What to Do:**
1. **Repeat Steps 4.2 & 4.3** for each panel:
   - Apply adhesive to next set of joists
   - Position panel (stagger end joints)
   - Leave ⅛" gaps at panel edges
   - Fasten per pattern

2. **Manage panel edges:**
   - Where two panels meet edge-to-edge (not on a joist), ensure panels are flush
   - If edge-milling is visible, sand lightly (do not create depressions)
   - Stagger joints so no two panels share a common joist line (structurally weak)

3. **Penetrations:**
   - Mark locations of drains, supply lines, vents per house plan
   - **Do NOT cut** yet (wait for MEP crew); mark with chalk outline instead

---

## Section 5: Below-Floor MEP (Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing)

### Step 5.1: Coordinate MEP Layout

**Before plumbing crew begins:**
1. Review house plan for drain, vent, and supply line locations
2. **Mark all penetration points** on subfloor with chalk or paint
3. Identify any **conflicts with joists or structural members** (e.g., vent line crosses a joist)
4. Notify Bay Supervisor or MEP crew of any conflicts

**Drainage Line Layout Example:**

```
        SUBFLOOR (top view)
    
    ┌────────────────────────────────┐
    │ ╱─ Vent Line                   │

    │            Main Drain Line → 90° Elbows
    │                   ↓            │
    └────────────────────────────────┘
              ↑ DRAIN DIRECTION
    
    All drain lines must be supported and secured
    No crossing structural members without header
```

---

### Step 5.2: Install Drain Lines & Vents

**Plumbing crew executes; Framing crew verifies:**

1. **Drain lines installed:**
   - Under subfloor (below joist level if possible)
   - Slope toward main drain (typically ¼" drop per 1' of length)
   - Supported every 4 feet with clamps or straps (do not rest directly on frame)
   - No unsupported spans > 4 feet

2. **Vents routed:**
   - Through penetrations if subfloor is complete
   - Or routed alongside/under joists before final sheathing
   - Secured to frame with clamps (prevent movement)

3. **Water supply lines installed:**
   - If routed under subfloor, secured and supported
   - Insulated if in unheated areas (freeze protection)
   - No sharp bends; use elbows/sweeps for direction changes

**Verification by Framing:**
- [ ] All lines secured and supported (no sagging)
- [ ] No lines resting on top of subfloor (trip hazard)
- [ ] All connections accessible or properly sealed
- [ ] Cap all open ends with plugs (contamination prevention)
- [ ] No MEP lines crossing structural members without structural header

---

### Step 5.3: Test & Document

**After MEP installed:**
1. **Photograph** all below-floor MEP (wide shots + detail shots of connections)
2. **Pressure test** drain lines (if required by plan): 5 psi for 15 minutes, no leaks
3. **Caulk or foam** any remaining gaps around penetrations (prevents pest entry)
4. **Document** MEP locations on an as-built drawing (if complex configuration)

**Photo Log:**
- [ ] Overall view of subfloor with all MEP visible
- [ ] Drain line slope and supports
- [ ] Vent routing and penetrations
- [ ] Water supply lines and insulation

---

## Section 6: Final Inspection & Hold Point Preparation

### Step 6.1: Self-Inspection by Crew

**Before scheduling HP-1 inspection, the Bay Supervisor and crew conduct full walk-through:**

**Checklist (use FORM-I002):**
- [ ] Frame square (diagonals ≤¼" difference) — verify with tape measure
- [ ] Joist spacing accurate (spot-check 5 locations with tape)
- [ ] Adhesive squeeze-out visible at ≥80% of joist-to-sheathing interfaces
- [ ] Fastener pattern complete and consistent (no shiners, even penetration)
- [ ] Subfloor surface smooth (walk across; feel for soft spots or humps)
- [ ] All gaps ⅛" or less at perimeter edges (use spacer to verify)
- [ ] No debris on subfloor (nails, sawdust, plastic); clean surface
- [ ] All penetration points marked and clear of obstructions
- [ ] MEP lines secured and documented (if applicable)
- [ ] Joist crown oriented upward (no saggy joists)
- [ ] Material certs on file (steel, lumber, adhesive, fasteners)

---

### Step 6.2: Prepare Hold Point Inspection

**Bay Supervisor responsibilities:**
1. **Clean bay:**
   - Remove all scrap lumber, nails, plastic, sawdust
   - Wipe subfloor surface clean
   - Clear walking paths for inspector

2. **Stage materials for review:**
   - Place all material certs in one location (folder or envelope)
   - Set fastener schedule on subfloor with photo
   - Prepare FORM-I002 (Floor System Inspection Checklist) — fill in job details

3. **Schedule inspection:**
   - Contact QA Manager or TPIA ≥24 hours before readiness
   - Provide estimated inspection time
   - Reserve bay (no conflicting activities during inspection)

4. **Notify Production Manager:**
   - Confirm Phase-1 completion target
   - Request Phase-2 crew schedule (if inspection passes)

---

## Section 7: Troubleshooting Quick Guide

### Problem: Frame Out of Square (>¼")

**Cause:** Chassis damage, improper positioning, or uneven shims

**Solution:**
1. Identify which corner(s) are high or low
2. Add shims under low corners; remove under high corners
3. Re-measure diagonals
4. Repeat until within tolerance

**Example:**

```
Diagonal A-C: 38' 2¼"
Diagonal B-D: 38' 1⅞"
DIFFERENCE:   ⅜" (OUT OF SPEC)

Add shim under corner D (lowest corner)
or remove shim under corner B (highest corner)
```

### Problem: Shiners (Missed Fasteners)

**Cause:** Fastener gun misfired, fastener skipped joist, or pneumatic pressure too low

**Solution:**
1. **Immediately re-nail** the location (do not defer)
2. Use hand nailing if pneumatic fails again
3. Tap-test all adjacent fasteners to ensure they are seated
4. Photograph the area after correction

**Prevention:**
- Test nail gun on scrap before start of shift
- Verify pneumatic pressure: 100–120 psi (check gauge frequently)
- Walk along joist line as you fasten (verify every nail hits joist)

### Problem: Adhesive Not Squeezed Out

**Cause:** Insufficient adhesive applied, adhesive set before panel installed, or panel not pressed firmly

**Solution:**
1. **If panel can be lifted:** Lift sheathing, apply more adhesive, and re-press
2. **If panel is fastened:** Document on NCR and assess structural impact (QA determines if acceptable)
3. **Prevention:** Apply adhesive in continuous bead; verify squeeze-out before moving to next panel

### Problem: Subfloor Soft Spot or Hump

**Cause:** Panel separation from joist (adhesive failure), joist twist, or improper sheathing installation

**Solution:**
1. **Identify problem area** with straightedge or by walking/feeling
2. **If soft spot:** Re-fasten with additional fasteners (16" o.c. grid pattern) or lift and re-glue
3. **If hump:** Check for joist twist; may require shim or panel replacement
4. **Document as NCR** if repair needed; QA to approve

### Problem: Joist Spacing Variance

**Cause:** Layout error, joist drift during fastening, or measurement error

**Solution:**
1. **Identify which joists are out of spec** (measure 5 random locations)
2. **If variance ≤½":** Acceptable; document on FORM-I002
3. **If variance >½":** Evaluate impact on wall layout
   - Minor variance (< 1"): May be acceptable with architectural approval
   - Major variance (>1"): May require re-layout and joist repositioning
4. **Escalate to Bay Supervisor & Production Manager** for disposition

## Section 8: Safety Reminders

- **Nail gun:** Always point away from body and coworkers; never put finger on trigger until ready to fire
- **Pneumatic pressure:** Check pressure gauge regularly; exceeding 120 psi can cause fastener to overdrive or ricochet
- **Fall protection:** If working on elevated platform or edge >6 feet, use fall protection harness
- **Dust & fumes:** Wear dust mask when cutting sheathing; ensure ventilation when using adhesives
- **Hearing protection:** Pneumatic tools exceed 85 dB; wear earplugs or earmuffs during fastening operations
- **Housekeeping:** Pick up nails and scrap daily to prevent injuries and tripping
