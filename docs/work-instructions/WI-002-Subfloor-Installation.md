## 1. Purpose
To provide step-by-step instructions for installing subfloor sheathing (OSB or plywood decking) over floor joists using proper adhesive application and fastening patterns to ensure structural performance and squeak-free floors.

## 2. Scope
Applies to all subfloor installations at Fort Homes, all models. Covers OSB and plywood sheathing per engineered plans.

## 3. Safety Requirements
* Wear safety glasses and steel-toe boots
* Use hearing protection when operating pneumatic nailers
* Use proper lifting techniques (decking sheets are heavy - 70-90 lbs)
* Use two-person lift for sheets, or mechanical assist
* Ensure stable footing when walking on joists before decking installed
* Keep work area clear of trip hazards
* Ventilate area when using adhesive (wear respirator if poor ventilation)

## 4. Materials and Tools Required

### 4.1 Materials
* **Subfloor Sheathing**: OSB or plywood per plan
  * Typical: 23/32" (3/4") Tongue-and-Groove (T&G) OSB, APA-rated "Exposure 1" or "Exterior"
  * Verify APA stamp on each sheet: Span rating must meet or exceed joist spacing (e.g., "48/24" for 24" OC joists)
* **Construction Adhesive**: Polyurethane-based (PL Premium, Liquid Nails Subfloor, or equivalent)
  * Verify expiration date (typically 12-18 months from manufacture)
  * Store indoors >50°F for proper dispensing
* **Fasteners**: Per engineering plan or IRC minimum:
  * Nails: 8d ring-shank or screw-shank nails, 2-3/8" long
  * OR Screws: #8 x 2-1/2" wood screws (preferred for reduced squeaks)
* **Vapor Retarder/Bottom Board** (if specified): Install before decking per plan

### 4.2 Tools
* Tape measure (25'), CALIBRATED
* Chalk line
* Circular saw or panel saw for cutting sheets
* Pneumatic nailer (for nails) or screw gun with depth stop (for screws)
* Adhesive caulk gun or pneumatic bulk gun
* Utility knife (for cutting T&G tongues at end joints)
* Hammer (for fitting T&G joints)
* Shims or pry bar (for closing gaps between sheets)
* Broom or blower (for cleaning joist tops before adhesive)

### 4.3 Engineering Plans
* Verify decking thickness, type (OSB vs. plywood), and fastening schedule
* Note any special details: openings, edge support requirements

## 5. Procedure

### Step 1: Pre-Installation Preparation
1.1. Verify floor joist assembly complete and inspected per WI-001

1.2. Clean joist tops:
   * Sweep or blow off sawdust, dirt, and debris
   * Adhesive will not bond to dirty surfaces
   * Check for protruding nails or screws; pound flush or remove

1.3. Verify material:
   * Check APA stamp on subfloor sheets (span rating, exposure durability)
   * Inspect sheets for damage: No delamination, water damage, or broken edges
   * Confirm adhesive not expired

1.4. Check weather:
   * If outdoor installation or open bay: No active rain (adhesive will not cure properly if wet)
   * Temperature >40°F for adhesive performance

1.5. Plan layout:
   * Sheets installed perpendicular to joists (long dimension across joists)
   * Stagger end joints: First row starts with full sheet, second row starts with half sheet (4' offset)
   * Leave expansion gaps: 1/8" between sheet edges (sides), 1/8" at walls/perimeter

---

### Step 2: Install First Row (Starting Edge)
2.1. Position first sheet at starting corner:
   * Typically start at front or rear of module (check plan for direction)
   * Tongue edge facing OUT (toward next sheet) or cut off if starting edge
   * Overhang rim joist by plan dimension (typically flush, or 1/2" - 1" overhang for siding lap)

2.2. Apply adhesive to joists:
   * Continuous 1/4" diameter bead along top center of each joist that sheet will cover
   * Do NOT skip joists
   * Apply adhesive to rim joist if sheet bears on rim
   * Work one sheet at a time (adhesive has ~10-15 min open time)

2.3. Set sheet onto joists:
   * Align edges with rim joist
   * Press down firmly along each joist to spread adhesive
   * Check for adhesive squeeze-out at joist edges (confirms good contact)

2.4. Fasten sheet:
   * **Edge Fastening** (edges supported by joists/rim):
     * 6" on-center (OC) along all supported edges
     * First fastener 3/8" from sheet edge, then every 6" along edge
   * **Field Fastening** (interior joists):
     * 12" on-center along each joist
     * Offset fasteners slightly from joist centerline to avoid splitting joist

2.5. Drive fasteners flush:
   * Nail/screw head should be flush with decking surface (NOT countersunk, NOT protruding)
   * If nail gun over-drives (creates dimple): Adjust air pressure or depth stop
   * If screw driver over-drives: Adjust torque setting

2.6. Inspect first sheet:
   * No gaps between sheet and rim joist (should be tight)
   * Fasteners at correct spacing and depth
   * Adhesive squeezed out along joists (visible from below if accessible)

---

### Step 3: Install Subsequent Sheets in Row
3.1. Apply adhesive to joists for next sheet location

3.2. Position next sheet:
   * Fit tongue into groove of previous sheet
   * May need to tap with hammer and block to close T&G joint
   * Leave 1/8" gap at end joints (butt joints between sheet ends)

3.3. Fasten per Step 2.4

3.4. Continue across row until reaching opposite end

3.5. Last sheet in row:
   * Measure remaining distance
   * Cut sheet to fit (leave 1/8" gap at wall/rim)
   * If cut removes tongue or groove: No T&G interlock at this joint, ensure edge fastening on supporting joist

---

### Step 4: Install Second and Subsequent Rows
4.1. Stagger end joints:
   * Start second row with half sheet (4' cut) to offset end joints from first row
   * End joints must land on joist centerline (supported by joist)

4.2. Apply adhesive and install sheets per Steps 2-3

4.3. Fit T&G along long edges (row-to-row joints):
   * Tap with hammer and block to close joint
   * If joint won't close (sheet warped or floor out-of-plane): Use shims or clamps to force into place, then fasten immediately

4.4. Continue rows until floor fully covered

---

### Step 5: Openings and Penetrations
5.1. **HVAC Chases, Stairs, or Large Openings**:
   * Cut sheets to frame opening per plan
   * Ensure all cut edges land on and fasten to joists, headers, or blocking
   * If unsupported edge: Install blocking between joists to support edge

5.2. **Plumbing Penetrations** (drain pipes, vent stacks):
   * Measure and mark penetration location on sheet before installing
   * Cut hole with jigsaw or hole saw (hole diameter = pipe OD + 1/4" clearance)
   * Install sheet with penetration
   * Seal penetration with caulk or foam after rough plumbing installed (prevents air leakage)

5.3. **Electrical Penetrations** (minimal floor penetrations typically):
   * Drill holes for wiring as needed after decking installed
   * Seal with fire-stop caulk if required

---

### Step 6: Final Inspection and Cleanup
6.1. Walk entire floor:
   * Check for loose sheets (tap with foot - should not move)
   * Check for protruding fasteners (pound flush)
   * Check for missed fasteners (add if edge or field pattern incomplete)

6.2. Verify no "shiners" (missed joists):
   * Look from below (if accessible) for nails/screws that missed joist (visible between joists)
   * Mark location, add fastener into joist

6.3. Check gaps:
   * Ensure 1/8" gaps at perimeter (allows expansion)
   * If sheets tight against wall: Score with utility knife to create gap

6.4. Clean surface:
   * Sweep off sawdust and debris
   * Remove adhesive squeeze-out from top surface (scrape or wipe while fresh)

6.5. Mark openings or hazards:
   * Chalk or tape any floor openings to prevent falls

6.6. Document:
   * Photos of completed floor (before walls installed)
   * Module Traveler checklist items signed by Crew Lead

## 6. Quality Checkpoints

| Checkpoint | Specification | Verification Method | Pass/Fail |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Sheathing type and thickness | Per plan (typically 23/32" T&G OSB, APA-rated) | Check APA stamp on random sheet | [ ] |
| Adhesive application | Continuous bead on all joists, no skips | Visual inspection from below (if accessible) or verify squeeze-out | [ ] |
| Fastener spacing - Edges | 6" OC along supported edges | Measure spacing at sample edge | [ ] |
| Fastener spacing - Field | 12" OC along interior joists | Measure spacing at sample joist | [ ] |
| Fastener depth | Flush with surface (not countersunk, not protruding) | Visual inspection, feel with hand | [ ] |
| T&G joints closed | No gaps >1/16" at T&G joints | Visual inspection | [ ] |
| End joint stagger | End joints offset min 24" row-to-row | Visual inspection | [ ] |
| Expansion gaps | 1/8" at perimeter and end joints | Measure with feeler gauge or visual | [ ] |
| No "shiners" | All fasteners into joists (not air) | View from below or verify joist locations marked on top | [ ] |

**All checkpoints must PASS before HP-1 inspection**

## 7. Common Errors to Avoid
* **Skipping adhesive**: Causes squeaks. Always apply continuous bead on every joist.
* **Over-driving fasteners**: Creates dimples that telegraph through finish flooring. Adjust tool depth.
* **Fasteners off-joist**: "Shiners" provide no holding power. Mark joist locations or snap chalk lines.
* **Ignoring expansion gaps**: Tight sheets can buckle when humidity increases. Maintain 1/8" gaps.
* **End joints not supported**: End joints must land on joist. If not, add blocking.
* **Walking on adhesive-only**: Sheet will shift before fasteners installed. Fasten immediately after setting.

---

## 8. Environmental Notes
* **Cold Weather** (<50°F):
  * Adhesive may be stiff and dispense slowly. Warm cartridges indoors before use.
  * Some adhesives may not cure properly <40°F. Consult product data sheet.
* **Hot Weather** (>90°F):
  * Adhesive may cure faster (reduced open time). Work quickly or apply smaller sections.
* **Wet Conditions**:
  * Do not install decking in rain. OSB will swell if wet before structure dried-in.
  * If decking gets wet during construction: Allow to dry completely, inspect for edge swell or delamination before proceeding.
