
# WI-102: Wall Framing & Sheathing (Phase 2) — CC21TE Update

---

**Source drawing:** Shop Drawings for CC21TE (SHOP FINAL)

Notes: This CC21TE variant highlights drawing callouts to be verified against the PDF and adds traceability placeholders (`data/cc21te/traceability.md`).

Key CC21TE items to confirm in shop drawings:
- Stud spacing and any deviation from 16" O.C.
- Header and lintel schedules (LVL sizes)
- Sheathing type and fastening pattern
- Window/door buck sizes and positions

Procedure: Use base `WI-102` procedures as the step-by-step execution; replace numeric callouts with values from `data/cc21te/cc21te-tasks.json` after extraction.

Deliverables (CC21TE):
- `wall-framing-checklist-cc21te.md`
- Update `data/cc21te/traceability.md` with exact page/figure references.
