# WI-101: CHASSIS & FLOOR DECK ASSEMBLY

**Phase 1 of 8** | **Hold Point: HP-1** | **Duration: 1-2 days**

---

## 📋 WHEN TO USE THIS

- Starting a new module in production bay
- After HP-1 failure requiring floor rebuild
- Module serial number assigned and chassis delivered

**Prerequisites:** Floor layout marked, engineered plans in bay, chassis delivered

---

## 🎯 CRITICAL SPECIFICATIONS

| What | Specification | Tolerance | Why It Matters |
|:-----|:-------------|:----------|:---------------|
| **Chassis Level** | Level both directions | **± ¼"** | Walls won't stand straight if floor isn't level |
| **Frame Square** | Diagonals equal | **± ½"** | Module won't square up, marriage issues |
| **Joist Spacing** | 16" on center | **± ¼"** | Subfloor won't hit joists, creates soft spots |
| **Subfloor Fasteners** | Edges: 6" / Field: 12" | ±1" | Squeaks, loose floors, inspection failure |
| **Expansion Gap** | ⅛" at perimeter | ±1/16" | Prevents floor buckling |
| **Adhesive** | Visible squeeze-out | ≥80% | No squeaks, solid floor |

## 🔧 TOOLS & MATERIALS (CHECKLIST)

**Tools:**
- [ ] Pneumatic nailer (100-120 psi) + ring-shank nails (8d/10d)
- [ ] 6 ft level OR laser level
- [ ] 25 ft tape measure
- [ ] Chalk line + chalk
- [ ] Circular saw
- [ ] Adhesive gun + subfloor adhesive

**Materials (verify before starting):**
- [ ] Steel chassis (model matches work order)
- [ ] I-joists (size per plan)
- [ ] Rim boards (LVL or engineered lumber)
- [ ] ¾" T&G subfloor sheathing (grade stamped)
- [ ] Subfloor adhesive (not expired)
- [ ] Blocking material (if required per plan)

---

## ⚠️ SAFETY - DON'T START WITHOUT

- [ ] Hard hat, safety glasses, gloves, steel-toed boots
- [ ] Hearing protection (nailer is LOUD)
- [ ] Forklift operator certified
- [ ] All personnel clear during chassis lift
- [ ] **STOP if:** Chassis damaged, dimensions >½" off, material defects

---

## 📐 STEP-BY-STEP ASSEMBLY

### STEP 1: Position & Level Chassis (30 min)

**DO THIS:**
1. Forklift operator lifts chassis into bay center
2. Lower onto shims/blocks
3. Check level BOTH directions with 6 ft level
4. Adjust shims until bubble centered (±¼")
5. Measure diagonals corner-to-corner

**CRITICAL MEASUREMENTS:**
- Diagonal A: ________ inches
- Diagonal B: ________ inches
- **Difference MUST be ≤½"** - If not, STOP and adjust chassis position

**🖼️ PHOTO 1:** [Level on chassis showing bubble centered within tolerance marks]

**🖼️ PHOTO 2:** [Measuring diagonal from corner to corner with tape measure]

**✅ PASS CRITERIA:**
- Level ±¼" both directions
- Diagonals differ ≤½"
- Chassis stable (doesn't rock)

**❌ REJECT IF:**
- Can't get level within ±¼"
- Diagonals differ >½"
- Visible chassis damage

---

### STEP 2: Install Rim Boards (45 min)

**DO THIS:**
1. Measure chassis sides, cut rim boards to length
2. Apply ¼" bead of adhesive on chassis top flange
3. Set rim board onto adhesive, press firmly
4. Nail with 16d nails @ **12" on center**
5. Check for adhesive squeeze-out (should see it along 80% of board)

**🖼️ PHOTO 3:** [Adhesive bead applied to chassis - show proper ¼" bead size]

**🖼️ PHOTO 4:** [Rim board installed with visible adhesive squeeze-out]

**COMMON MISTAKES:**
- ❌ No adhesive squeeze-out = not enough adhesive or not pressed down
- ❌ Gaps at corners >⅛" = mismeasured or bad cut
- ❌ Nails not at 12" spacing = will fail inspection

**✅ PASS:** Adhesive visible, corners tight, nails at 12" O.C.

---

### STEP 3: Layout & Install Joists (3 hours)

**DO THIS:**
1. Mark joist locations on rim boards: **16" on center**
2. Start from one end, mark every 16" with square
3. Number each location (1, 2, 3...)
4. Apply ¼" adhesive bead where joist will sit
5. Set I-joist on marks, press into adhesive
6. Nail through rim board into joist (3 nails minimum per end)
7. Install blocking at mid-span (if required by plan)

**🖼️ PHOTO 5:** [Layout marks on rim board showing 16" spacing with numbers]

**🖼️ PHOTO 6:** [I-joist positioned on adhesive, showing crown up orientation]

**CRITICAL:** Joist crown MUST face UP - sight down joist to find crown

**CHECK SPACING:** Measure every 3rd joist
- Joist 1-2: ________ (target: 16" ±¼")
- Joist 5-6: ________ (target: 16" ±¼")
- Joist 10-11: ________ (target: 16" ±¼")

**COMMON MISTAKES:**
- ❌ Spacing drifts - measure from starting point, not last joist
- ❌ Joists twist - need blocking or temporary bracing
- ❌ Crown down - floor will sag

---

### STEP 4: Snap Chalk Lines for Fasteners (10 min)

**DO THIS:**
1. Snap chalk lines across floor at **16" intervals** (over joists)
2. First line should be at first joist centerline
3. Verify lines align with joist centers below

**🖼️ PHOTO 7:** [Chalk lines snapped on subfloor showing 16" spacing]

**WHY:** Lines guide nailing so you HIT joists (no "shiners")

---

### STEP 5: Install Subfloor Sheathing (4 hours)

**DO THIS:**
1. Apply ¼" adhesive bead on TOP of each joist
2. Position first panel at corner, perpendicular to joists
3. Leave **⅛" gap at perimeter** (expansion space)
4. Walk on panel to press adhesive before nailing
5. Nail along chalk lines:
   - **Edges (perimeter): 6" on center**
   - **Field (interior joists): 12" on center**
6. Install next panel with ⅛" gap, stagger end joints by 4 ft
7. Check for adhesive squeeze-out between panel and joist

**🖼️ PHOTO 8:** [Adhesive bead on joist - show proper ¼" bead]

**🖼️ PHOTO 9:** [First panel positioned showing ⅛" gap at edge with measurement]

**🖼️ PHOTO 10:** [Nailing pattern - show 6" spacing at edge vs 12" in field]

**🖼️ PHOTO 11:** [Adhesive squeeze-out visible between panel and joist]

**FASTENER PATTERN (MEMORIZE THIS):**
```
Edge of panel (on rim board):  Nail every 6"
Interior joists:                Nail every 12"
Nail ON the chalk line:         Hits joist center
```

**COMMON MISTAKES:**
- ❌ "Shiners" (nails miss joist) - nail on chalk line!
- ❌ Nails overdriven (dimple in sheathing) - reduce air pressure to 100 psi
- ❌ No expansion gap - floor will buckle when wood expands
- ❌ End joints align - creates weak point, always stagger by 4 ft

**CHECK AS YOU GO:**
- Walk on installed panels - should be solid, no squeaks or movement
- Tap nails with hammer - should be flush and tight
- Look for adhesive squeeze-out - should see it at 80% of joist contacts

---

### STEP 6: Mark Wall & MEP Layout (30 min)

**DO THIS:**
1. Using plans, measure and mark wall centerlines on floor
2. Snap chalk lines for exterior walls (use one color)
3. Snap chalk lines for interior walls (use different color)
4. Mark MEP penetration locations with paint/marker:
   - Label "E1, E2" for electrical
   - Label "P1, P2" for plumbing
   - Label "H1, H2" for HVAC
   - Include size: "P1 - 3" DWV"

**🖼️ PHOTO 12:** [Floor with wall layout lines snapped, clearly visible]

**🖼️ PHOTO 13:** [MEP penetration marked with label and size]

**WHY:** Wall crew needs these lines. MEP crew needs penetration marks.

## 🔍 GOOD vs BAD EXAMPLES

### Adhesive Application
| ✅ GOOD | ❌ BAD |
|:--------|:-------|
| **[PHOTO: Continuous adhesive squeeze-out visible]** | **[PHOTO: No adhesive visible - dry connection]** |
| • Visible along 80%+ of joist | • No squeeze-out |
| • Indicates good bond | • Will squeak |

### Fastening Pattern
| ✅ GOOD | ❌ BAD |
|:--------|:-------|
| **[PHOTO: Nails at 6" edge, 12" field, on chalk lines]** | **[PHOTO: Random spacing, nails off chalk line]** |
| • Consistent spacing | • Irregular spacing |
| • Nails on chalk line (hits joist) | • Nails miss joists ("shiners") |

### Chassis Leveling
| ✅ GOOD | ❌ BAD |
|:--------|:-------|
| **[PHOTO: Level bubble centered within marks]** | **[PHOTO: Bubble way off center]** |
| • Within ±¼" tolerance | • Outside tolerance |
| • Stable shim stack | • Unstable/excessive shims |

## ❗ TROUBLESHOOTING - FIX IT NOW

| Problem | What to Check | Fix |
|:--------|:--------------|:----|
| **Soft spot in floor** | 1. Walk on soft area<br>2. Check from below if accessible<br>3. Tap nails with hammer | • Add nails in soft spot<br>• Ensure nails hit joist<br>• Check for missing adhesive |
| **Squeaky floor** | 1. Walk on squeak<br>2. Check for adhesive squeeze-out | • Add screws in squeaky area<br>• Likely insufficient adhesive |
| **Joist spacing drifts** | 1. Measure from starting point<br>2. Count joists vs plan | • Adjust remaining joists to compensate<br>• Redistribute spacing |
| **Chassis won't level** | 1. Check floor flatness<br>2. Inspect chassis for damage | • Use thicker shims<br>• If >2" needed, call supervisor |
| **Panel edge raised** | 1. Check joist with straightedge<br>2. Inspect panel for warp | • Plane joist high spot<br>• Replace warped panel |
