   - Add ½" to each measurement for cutting allowance
   - Record measurements:
     - Front: ________
     - Rear: ________
     - Left: ________
     - Right: ________

2. **Cut rim boards to length**
   - Use circular saw with sharp blade
   - Measure twice, cut once
   - Cut square ends (90° using speed square)
   - Label each piece (F=Front, R=Rear, L=Left, R=Right)

3. **Check material condition**
   - Verify grade stamp visible on each piece
   - Inspect for splits >12" (reject if found)
   - Check for twists or bows (reject if >¼" over length)
   - Confirm moisture content ≤18% (use moisture meter)

4. **Test fit rim boards**
   - Lay boards in position without fastening
   - Verify corners meet flush (no gaps >⅛")
   - Check that boards sit flush on chassis top flange
   - Adjust cuts if needed

**Photos:**

*[Photo: Rim boards cut and labeled]*
*[Photo: Test fit showing flush corner joint]*

**✅ Quality Check:**
- [ ] All rim boards cut to correct length (± ⅛")
- [ ] Grade stamps visible
- [ ] No defects (splits, twists, water damage)
- [ ] Corners fit flush with no gaps

<div style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #FFF3E0 0%, #FFE0B2 100%); border-left: 4px solid #FF9800; padding: 16px; margin: 16px 0; border-radius: 4px;">
  <strong>💡 PRO TIP</strong><br>
  Always cut rim boards 1/16" longer than the measured dimension. You can sand or plane them flush, but you can't add length back. A tight fit is better than a gap.
</div>

---

**Step 3.2: Apply adhesive and fasten rim boards**

**What to do:**

1. **Prepare adhesive**
   - Check adhesive expiration date (reject if expired)
   - Verify temperature is above 50°F (adhesive won't bond properly if cold)
   - Load adhesive into applicator or caulk gun
   - Cut nozzle tip at 45° angle (¼" bead diameter)

2. **Apply adhesive to chassis**
   - Run continuous ¼" bead along top of chassis flange
   - Apply to area where rim board will sit
   - Work in sections (apply adhesive for one side at a time)
   - Ensure no gaps or skips in adhesive bead

3. **Position rim board**
   - Set board onto adhesive-covered chassis
   - Press firmly to spread adhesive
   - Verify board is flush with chassis edge
   - Check that board is level (use 4 ft level)

4. **Fasten rim board**
   - Follow fastener schedule: **16d nails @ 12" O.C.** (or per plan)
   - Start at one end and work toward the other
   - Drive nails perpendicular to board (not angled)
   - Verify nails penetrate at least 1½" into chassis or mounting surface
   - Check for adhesive squeeze-out (should be visible along chassis)

5. **Repeat for all four sides**
   - Install front, rear, left, right rim boards
   - Ensure corners overlap properly (butt joint or miter per plan)
   - Verify all boards are level and flush

**Photos - Sequence:**

*Photo 1: Adhesive bead applied to chassis*

- [ ] Fastener pattern matches schedule (12" O.C.)
- [ ] All fasteners driven flush (no overdriven or protruding nails)
- [ ] Rim boards level and flush with chassis
- [ ] Corners fit tight (gaps ≤⅛")

**Common Problems & Solutions:**

| Problem | Likely Cause | Solution |
|:--------|:------------|:---------|
| Adhesive not squeezing out | Insufficient adhesive or uneven board | Remove board, add more adhesive, reinstall. Check for voids. |
| Nail gun jams during fastening | Wrong fastener size or air pressure | Clear jam, verify 16d nails and 100-120 psi pressure. Test on scrap. |
| Rim board twists when fastening | Board has bow or pressure uneven | Pre-drill holes if board resists. Clamp board straight while fastening. |
| Corner joint has gap | Mismeasurement or cut not square | Fill gap ≤⅛" with adhesive. If >⅛", re-cut board to proper length. |

**What to do:**

1. **Snap chalk lines for joist layout**
   - Measure and mark joist locations on rim boards
   - Typical spacing: **16" on center (O.C.)** - verify against plan
   - Start layout from one end (usually left side)
   - Mark both front and rear rim boards

2. **Create layout marks**
   - Use square to mark perpendicular line across rim board
   - Mark "X" on the side where joist will sit
   - Number each joist location (1, 2, 3, etc.)
   - Verify spacing: Measure every 5th mark (should be 5 × 16" = 80")

3. **Check layout against plan**
   - Count total number of joists (compare to plan count)
   - Verify spacing at openings or special conditions
   - Note any joists that need to be doubled or reinforced

---

**Step 4.2: Install blocking and joist hangers (if required)**

**What to do:**

1. **Review plan for blocking requirements**
   - Check if plan specifies blocking at mid-span
   - Verify if joist hangers are required (typical for rim board connections)
   - Note any special blocking at openings

2. **Install joist hangers** (if specified)
   - Position hanger at layout mark
   - Align hanger square to rim board
   - Fasten with specified nails (typically 10d or joist hanger nails)
   - Fill all nail holes in hanger (no empty holes allowed)

3. **Cut and prepare blocking** (if specified)
   - Cut blocking material to fit between joists
   - Typical blocking: 2×6 or 2×8, cut to 14½" length (for 16" O.C. spacing)
   - Install at mid-span per plan

**Photos:**

*[Photo: Joist hanger installed and fully nailed]*

**Step 4.3: Install I-joists**

**What to do:**

1. **Prepare I-joists**
   - Inspect each joist for damage (look for flange cracks, web damage)
   - Reject any joist with cracks >2" or damaged flanges
   - Orient joists with crown UP (sight down joist to find crown)
   - Stage joists near installation area (prevent bowing)

2. **Apply adhesive to bearing points**
   - Apply ¼" bead of adhesive on rim board at joist location
   - Apply adhesive to both front and rear bearing points
   - Ensure full contact width (across entire joist flange width)

3. **Set joist in position**
   - Lift joist and position on layout mark
   - Press firmly onto adhesive
   - Verify joist is perpendicular to rim board (90°)
   - Check that joist is sitting flat on chassis or rim board

4. **Fasten joist to rim board**
   - Drive fasteners per schedule (typical: **3 × 16d nails** per bearing point)
   - Nail through rim board into joist end flange
   - Alternate nail locations (don't line up all nails - causes splitting)
   - Or, if using joist hangers: Set joist into hanger, nail through hanger holes

5. **Check joist alignment**
   - Use string line from front to rear
   - Verify joist is plumb (vertical) using level on web
   - Adjust if joist is leaning or twisted

6. **Repeat for all joists**
   - Work systematically from one end to the other
   - Verify spacing as you go (measure every 3rd joist)
   - Install all joists before proceeding to blocking

  - Joist 1-2: ________ (target 16" ± ¼")
  - Joist 5-6: ________ (target 16" ± ¼")
  - Joist 10-11: ________ (target 16" ± ¼")

**✅ Quality Check:**
- [ ] All joists have crown facing up
- [ ] Joists spaced 16" O.C. ± ¼"
- [ ] Adhesive applied to all bearing points
- [ ] Fasteners per schedule (3 nails minimum per bearing)
- [ ] Joists plumb (vertical) and perpendicular to rim boards
- [ ] No damaged joists installed

**Common Problems & Solutions:**

| Problem | Likely Cause | Solution |
|:--------|:------------|:---------|
| Joist spacing drifts out of tolerance | Layout marks incorrect or joist shifted | Re-measure from starting point. Adjust remaining joists to compensate. |
| Joist won't sit flush on rim board | Rim board high spot or joist warped | Plane or sand rim board. Replace warped joist if bow >¼". |
| Joist twists after installation | Insufficient bracing or joist defect | Install temporary bracing. Check if joist is defective (flange damage). |
| Adhesive not squeezing out | Insufficient adhesive applied | Add more adhesive before next joist. Check previous joists - may need to remove and reapply. |

**Step 4.4: Install bridging or blocking**

**What to do:**

1. **Determine blocking type and location**
   - Review plan for blocking requirements
   - Typical: Solid blocking at mid-span (8 ft from rim board for 16 ft span)
   - Alternative: Diagonal bridging (metal or wood X-bracing)

2. **Install solid blocking** (if specified)
   - Measure distance between joists (typically 14½" for 16" O.C.)
   - Cut 2× material (2×6 or 2×8 per plan) to fit snugly between joists
   - Offset blocking (stagger pattern - easier to nail)
   - Toenail or end-nail blocking to joists (2 nails per end)

3. **Install diagonal bridging** (if specified)
   - Use metal bridging straps or wood cross-bracing
   - Install per manufacturer instructions
   - Nail top end first, pull tight, nail bottom end

4. **Verify blocking alignment**
   - Sight down blocking row - should be straight
   - Check that blocking is tight against joist flanges
   - Confirm blocking doesn't cause joists to twist

**Photos:**

*[Photo: Solid blocking installed between joists]*
*[Photo: Diagonal bridging (if used)]*

**✅ Quality Check:**
- [ ] Blocking installed at mid-span (or per plan)
- [ ] Blocking fits snugly between joists
- [ ] Fasteners secure (2 nails per connection minimum)
- [ ] Blocking doesn't cause joist twisting

#### Step 5: Install Subfloor Sheathing

**Time:** 3-5 hours

**Objective:** Install and fasten subfloor sheathing to create solid, structural floor surface

**Prerequisites:**
- ✅ Step 4 completed and all joists installed
- ✅ Subfloor sheathing on-site and acclimated

**Step 5.1: Prepare sheathing material**

**What to do:**

1. **Verify sheathing material**
   - Check thickness: **¾" T&G OSB or plywood** (per plan)
   - Verify grade stamp visible on each sheet
   - Inspect for water damage, delamination, or defects
   - Reject any sheet with damage

2. **Acclimate sheathing** (if needed)
   - If temperature <50°F or humidity >85%: Acclimate 24 hours
   - Stack sheathing with spacers (allow air circulation)
   - Keep sheathing covered and dry until installation

3. **Plan sheathing layout**
   - Arrange panels perpendicular to joists
   - Stagger end joints (don't align end joints between rows)
   - Start with full sheets at one end
   - Mark cut lines for final sheets

**Photos:**

*[Photo: Sheathing stack showing grade stamps]*
*[Photo: Layout sketch showing staggered joints]*

**✅ Quality Check:**
- [ ] Sheathing is correct thickness (¾")
- [ ] Grade stamps visible
- [ ] No water damage or delamination
- [ ] Layout planned to minimize waste

---

**Step 5.2: Snap chalk lines for fastening**

**What to do:**

1. **Mark joist centerlines on sheathing**
   - Use chalk line to snap lines at 16" intervals
   - Snap lines across entire floor system
   - These lines guide nail placement (ensures nails hit joists)

2. **Verify chalk lines align with joists**
   - Measure from edge to first chalk line
   - Should match distance from edge to first joist center
   - Adjust if needed

**Photos:**

*[Photo: Chalk lines snapped showing 16" spacing]*

**✅ Quality Check:**
- [ ] Chalk lines at 16" O.C.
- [ ] Lines align with joist centers

---

**Step 5.3: Apply adhesive and install sheathing**

**What to do:**

1. **Apply construction adhesive**
   - Work in sections (adhesive for 1-2 sheets at a time)
   - Apply continuous ¼" bead on top of each joist
   - Ensure bead is centered on joist (nail will compress adhesive)
   - Apply adhesive to rim boards as well

2. **Position first sheathing panel**
   - Start at corner (typically front-left)
   - Orient panel perpendicular to joists
   - Align panel edge with outside edge of rim board
   - Leave **⅛" gap** at perimeter edges (expansion space)

3. **Verify tongue-and-groove engagement**
   - If T&G sheathing: Ensure grooves fully engage tongues
   - Tap edge with rubber mallet if needed (don't force - can damage tongue)
   - Check that panel is flat (no raised corners)

4. **Fasten sheathing**
   - Follow fastener schedule:
     - **Edges (on rim boards/perimeter joists): 6" O.C.**
     - **Field (interior joists): 12" O.C.**
   - Use pneumatic nail gun (ring-shank nails: 8d or 10d)
   - Drive nails flush (not overdriven - can crush sheathing)
   - Nail along chalk lines (ensures hitting joists - no "shiners")

5. **Verify adhesive squeeze-out**
   - Check between panel edge and joist
   - Should see adhesive squeeze-out at ≥80% of joist contacts
   - If no squeeze-out: May need more adhesive on next panel

6. **Install subsequent panels**
   - Apply adhesive to joists for next panel
   - Position next panel with ⅛" gap from previous panel
   - Stagger end joints (offset by ≥4 ft from previous row)
   - Continue until floor is fully sheated

*Photo 2: First panel positioned with ⅛" gap*
*Photo 3: Nailing pattern showing 6" edge spacing*
*Photo 4: Completed section showing staggered joints*
*Photo 5: Adhesive squeeze-out visible between panel and joist*

**Measurement:**
- Verify expansion gaps:
  - Front perimeter: ________ (target ⅛" ± 1/16")
  - Rear perimeter: ________ (target ⅛" ± 1/16")
  - Left perimeter: ________ (target ⅛" ± 1/16")
  - Right perimeter: ________ (target ⅛" ± 1/16")

**✅ Quality Check:**
- [ ] Adhesive applied to all joists supporting panel
- [ ] Panels perpendicular to joists
- [ ] ⅛" expansion gap at all perimeter edges
- [ ] End joints staggered (offset ≥4 ft)
- [ ] Fastener pattern matches schedule (6" edges, 12" field)
- [ ] All fasteners driven flush (not overdriven)
- [ ] Adhesive squeeze-out visible at ≥80% of joist contacts
- [ ] No "shiners" (missed joists) - check from below if accessible

**Common Problems & Solutions:**

| Problem | Likely Cause | Solution |
|:--------|:------------|:---------|
| Panel won't lay flat (corners raised) | Joist high spot or panel warped | Check joists with straightedge. Plane high spots. Replace warped panels. |
| Fastener "shiners" (missed joists) | Nail gun off chalk line or joist shifted | Pull "shiner" nails immediately. Re-nail 2" away hitting joist. Check all nails. |
| Adhesive not squeezing out | Insufficient adhesive or panel not pressed down | Apply more adhesive on next panel. Walk on panel to press adhesive before nailing. |
| Tongue damaged during panel installation | Forcing panel or misalignment | Ease panel into place. Tap with rubber mallet on scrap block, not directly on tongue. |
| Gap >⅛" at perimeter | Sheathing cut oversize or layout error | If gap <¼": Acceptable. If >¼": Trim panel or adjust subsequent panel positions. |
| Fastener overdriven (dimple in sheathing) | Pneumatic pressure too high | Reduce air pressure to 100-110 psi. Test on scrap. Overdriven nails reduce holding power. |

  <strong>💡 PRO TIP</strong><br>
  After installing each panel, walk across it before nailing. This presses the adhesive and helps you feel for soft spots or high joists. Fix issues immediately - much harder after nailing.
