## 1. Purpose
To define the quality standards and inspection criteria for the construction of the floor system (chassis/deck), ensuring structural integrity and compliance with approved engineering plans.

## 2. Scope
This procedure applies to the "Stage 1" production station, covering:
* Rim joist and floor joist assembly.
* Structural steel chassis integration (if applicable).
* Subfloor adhesive and fastening.
* Bottom board/rodent barrier installation.
* Insulation installation (if performed at this stage).

## 3. References
* Approved Engineering Plans (Model Specific)
* IRC Chapter 5 (Floors)
* SOP-007 (Nonconforming Outputs)

## 4. Procedure

### 4.1 Preparation
1.  **Plan Verification**: Production Lead verifies they have the current, stamped engineering plans for the specific unit being built.
2.  **Material Check**: Verify lumber grade (e.g., No. 2 or better), I-joist specs, and adhesive expiration dates.

### 4.2 Assembly
1.  **Squaring**: The rim joist assembly must be square.
    * *Tolerance*: Diagonals must be within 1/8" (3mm).
2.  **Joist Spacing**: Install joists according to plan (typically 16" or 24" o.c.).
3.  **Fastening**:
    * Verify nail gun pressure (prevent shiners or over-driving).
    * Apply construction adhesive to top of joists before laying decking.
4.  **Decking**: Install subfloor (OSB/Plywood) perpendicular to joists. Stagger joints. Leave 1/8" gap at edges for expansion.

### 4.3 Quality Control (Hold Point)
**STOP WORK**: The floor system cannot move to Framing until the **FORM-I001** inspection is passed.

## 5. Inspection Criteria (Summary)
* [ ] Diagonals check (Squareness)
* [ ] Joist spacing matches plan
* [ ] Glue visible on joist tops (squeeze out)
* [ ] Nailing pattern matches Nailing Schedule
* [ ] Penetrations (plumbing/HVAC) strictly follow framing allowances

## 6. Records
* FORM-I001 (Floor System Inspection Checklist)
