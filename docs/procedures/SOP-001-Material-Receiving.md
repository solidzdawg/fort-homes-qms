## 4. Work Instructions: Material Receiving Process

### Step 1: Delivery Arrival

1. Receiving Clerk greets delivery driver and obtains:
   - Delivery ticket / bill of lading
   - Packing slip
   - Any accompanying certifications or documentation
2. Verify delivery matches expected purchase order:
   - PO number
   - Supplier name
   - General material description
3. Direct driver to appropriate unloading area based on material type
4. Ensure safe unloading zone (clear of obstructions, adequate space, proper equipment available)

### Step 2: Physical Inspection During Unloading

**Receiving Clerk performs visual inspection:**

1. **Count Verification:**
   - Count all items as unloaded (bundles, boxes, pallets, individual pieces)
   - Compare to packing slip quantity

2. **Damage Inspection (by material type):**

   **Structural Lumber:**
   - Check for splits, checks, or cracks exceeding allowable limits
   - Inspect for severe warping, twisting, or bowing
   - Look for moisture damage, mold, or staining
   - Verify bundle strapping is intact

   **Engineered Wood Products (I-joists, LVL, plywood, OSB):**
   - Check for delamination or separation of layers
   - Inspect for crushing, dents, or impact damage
   - Look for water damage, swelling, or discoloration
   - Verify protective wrapping is intact

   **Fasteners and Hardware:**
   - Check for rust, corrosion, or oxidation
   - Inspect containers for damage or moisture intrusion
   - Verify packaging is sealed and labeled

   **Windows and Doors:**
   - Inspect for broken glass or damaged glazing
   - Check frames for dents, scratches, or warping
   - Verify protective packaging is intact
   - Test operation if possible (doors should open/close)

3. **Segregation:**
   - Immediately segregate any visibly damaged items
   - Do not mix damaged items with acceptable materials
   - Photograph damaged items before driver departs

4. **Delivery Ticket Notation:**
   - Note any discrepancies (quantity variances, damage) on delivery ticket
   - Have driver acknowledge and sign notation
   - Obtain driver signature and departure time

### Step 3: Documentation Collection and Review

**Receiving Clerk actions:**

1. Collect all documentation from driver:
   - Delivery ticket / packing slip (signed by driver)
   - Material certifications (mill certificates, grade stamps, test reports)
   - Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS/SDS) if required
   - Chain of custody documentation (if applicable)

2. Deliver complete documentation package to FH QC Inspector within 2 hours of receipt

3. Attach copy of purchase order to documentation package

**FH QC Inspector actions:**

1. Review documentation within 24 hours of material receipt
2. Verify completeness of required certifications
3. Schedule physical material verification inspection

## 5. Internal QC Hold Point

### ✅ **Internal QC Hold #1: Material Verification**

**Hold Point Trigger:** All materials must pass this internal QC verification before release to production use.

**Responsible Party:** FH QC Inspector

**Timing:** Within 24 hours of material receipt

**Inspection Location:** Receiving area or designated inspection zone
