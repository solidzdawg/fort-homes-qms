## 5. Procedure

### 5.1 Supplier Evaluation and Approval

#### 5.1.1 Initial Supplier Evaluation
Before adding supplier to ASL, evaluate using criteria:

**Quality Capability (Weight: 40%)**
* ISO 9001 or equivalent quality system certification (preferred but not mandatory)
* Product certifications (APA, UL, NSF, ICC-ES, IAPMO, AHRI, etc.)
* Material testing capabilities (mill certs, lab reports)
* Returns/defect rate from other customers (if available)

**Delivery Performance (Weight: 25%)**
* Lead time reliability
* Order accuracy
* Geographic proximity (prefer local/regional to minimize transport damage)

**Technical Support (Weight: 15%)**
* Availability of technical data sheets
* Engineering support for specifications
* Training on proper installation/use

**Business Stability (Weight: 10%)**
* Years in business
* Financial stability indicators (credit rating, references)
* Insurance coverage (liability, product liability)

**Cost Competitiveness (Weight: 10%)**
* Pricing relative to market
* Payment terms
* Volume discount availability

**Evaluation Process:**
1. COO or QA Manager identifies potential supplier
2. Request supplier to complete Fort Homes Supplier Questionnaire (FORM-SUP01)
3. Conduct evaluation using Supplier Evaluation Form (FORM-SUP02)
4. Score supplier: ≥75% required for approval
5. If approved: Add to ASL with approved product categories
6. If <75%: Reject, or approve provisionally for trial period (3 months, then re-evaluate)

#### 5.1.2 Approved Supplier List (ASL)
* Maintained by COO in shared spreadsheet or ERP system (NetSuite, if implemented)
* Columns:
  * Supplier Name
  * Contact Information
  * Approved Product Categories
  * Evaluation Score
  * Approval Date
  * Next Review Date (annual)
  * Status (Active, Provisional, Suspended, Removed)
* ASL accessible to all Bay Supervisors and purchasing personnel

### 5.2 Purchasing Process

#### 5.2.1 Material Requisition
1. Bay Supervisor identifies material need based on:
   * Production schedule (modules in queue)
   * Engineering plan material takeoffs
   * Inventory levels (maintain 2-week minimum stock for common items)
2. Submits requisition to COO via email specifying:
   * Material description and specification (e.g., "2x6 SPF Stud, #2 or better, kiln-dried")
   * Quantity
   * Required delivery date
   * Applicable project/module serial number(s)

#### 5.2.2 Purchase Order Creation
1. COO reviews requisition for:
   * Specification clarity (matches engineering plans)
   * Budget availability
   * Preferred supplier from ASL
2. COO creates PO including:
   * PO number (sequential: PO-YYYY-####)
   * Supplier name and contact
   * Item description (detailed specifications)
   * Quantity and unit of measure
   * Unit price and total
   * Delivery location (Fort Homes facility address)
   * Required delivery date
   * Quality requirements: "Material certifications required with delivery"
   * Acceptance criteria: "Subject to inspection upon receipt per Fort Homes QMS"
   * Payment terms
3. For critical materials, PO includes specific requirements:
   * Lumber: "Grade stamps required on all pieces, per WWPA/NELMA grading rules"
   * Electrical: "UL listing required, NEC 2023 compliant"
   * Plumbing: "NSF-61 certified for potable water contact, ICC-ES listed"
   * Trusses: "Engineered with truss engineer seal, load tables included"
   * Fire-rated materials: "UL fire rating documentation required"

#### 5.2.3 PO Approval
* POs ≤$10,000: COO approves
* POs >$10,000: President approves
* PO transmitted to supplier via email, fax, or supplier portal

### 5.3 Receiving and Inspection

#### 5.3.1 Delivery Receipt
1. Receiving personnel (or Bay Supervisor if no dedicated receiving) verify:
   * Delivery matches PO (supplier, PO number, items)
   * Quantities correct (count pieces, measure lengths if applicable)
   * No visible damage (shrink-wrap intact, no broken bundles, no water damage)
   * Material certifications included (mill certs, test reports, spec sheets)
2. Sign delivery receipt or BOL (Bill of Lading)
3. Note any discrepancies on BOL: "Received 95 pieces, PO specified 100" or "Shrink wrap torn, inspecting for damage"

#### 5.3.2 Material Certification Verification
* QA Manager (or designee) reviews certifications for:
  * **Lumber**: Grade stamps visible on pieces (check random sample), species and grade match PO
  * **Engineered lumber (I-joists, LVL, PSL)**: Manufacturer certification, ICC-ES report number
  * **Trusses**: Truss engineer seal on design drawings, truss plates ICC-ES listed
  * **Electrical materials**: UL listing mark on products, spec sheets confirm NEC compliance
  * **Plumbing materials**: NSF-61 mark for water contact, pressure ratings match PO
  * **Drywall**: ASTM C36 (standard) or ASTM C1396 (Type X fire-rated), thickness correct
  * **Insulation**: R-value certification label, ASTM standards compliance
  * **HVAC equipment**: AHRI certification, energy efficiency ratings (SEER, AFUE)
* If certification missing or non-compliant: Material quarantined (see Section 5.5)

#### 5.3.3 Receiving Inspection
* Visual inspection for damage, defects, or deviations from specification
* Random sampling for verification (e.g., measure lumber dimensions with calipers, check moisture content with moisture meter)
* Inspection documented on Receiving Inspection Form (FORM-RCV01) if critical material
* Accept: Material released to inventory, marked with receiving date and PO number
* Reject: Material segregated, supplier notified, NCR initiated (SOP-007)

### 5.4 Inventory Management

#### 5.4.1 Storage
* Materials stored per manufacturer requirements:
  * Lumber: Indoor, dry, elevated on blocks (prevent ground moisture)
  * Drywall: Flat stacks, protected from moisture
  * Adhesives/caulks: Temperature-controlled (check expiration dates)
  * Paint/coatings: Prevent freezing, maintain 50-90°F
  * Electrical: Dry, protected from physical damage
* Storage areas labeled with product name and PO number

#### 5.4.2 FIFO (First In, First Out)
* Older stock used before newer stock
* Especially critical for:
  * Adhesives and sealants (expiration dates)
  * Paint (shelf life ~2 years)
  * Any product with date coding

#### 5.4.3 Inventory Tracking
* Materials logged in inventory system (spreadsheet or NetSuite)
* Key data: Product, Quantity, PO number, Receive date, Expiration date (if applicable)
* Physical inventory count: Quarterly

### 5.5 Nonconforming Purchased Materials

#### 5.5.1 Identification
If material found nonconforming (missing cert, damaged, wrong spec):
1. Segregate material immediately (move to Quarantine Area or mark with RED TAG)
2. Notify QA Manager
3. Initiate NCR (FORM-NCR01, reference PO number and supplier)

#### 5.5.2 Disposition
QA Manager determines disposition:
* **Return to Supplier**: Most common for wrong items, damaged goods, or missing certs
* **Use As Is**: If deviation is minor and does not affect compliance (requires engineering review for structural/critical items)
* **Scrap/Discard**: If damaged beyond use and supplier will not accept return

#### 5.5.3 Supplier Notification
* COO contacts supplier with:
  * Description of nonconformance
  * Photos (if applicable)
  * Request for replacement or credit
  * Deadline for resolution
* Document supplier response and corrective action
* Supplier nonconformance recorded in Supplier Performance Log

### 5.6 Supplier Performance Monitoring

#### 5.6.1 Performance Metrics
Track quarterly for each active supplier:
* **On-Time Delivery Rate**: % of POs delivered by required date (Target: ≥95%)
* **Quality Acceptance Rate**: % of deliveries accepted without NCR (Target: ≥98%)
* **Order Accuracy**: % of POs received with correct items and quantities (Target: ≥99%)
* **Certification Compliance**: % of deliveries with complete and correct material certs (Target: 100% for critical materials)

#### 5.6.2 Quarterly Supplier Review
* COO and QA Manager review Supplier Performance Log
* Identify underperforming suppliers (below targets for 2+ consecutive quarters)
* Actions:
  * **Meet target performance**: Continue as approved supplier
  * **Below target, first occurrence**: Issue Supplier Corrective Action Request (FORM-SUP03), require improvement plan
  * **Below target, recurring**: Place on Provisional status, reduce order volume, seek alternate supplier
  * **Critical failure (safety/compliance issue)**: Immediate suspension, remove from ASL pending resolution

#### 5.6.3 Annual Supplier Re-Evaluation
* All ASL suppliers re-evaluated annually using original evaluation criteria
* Score must remain ≥75% to continue as approved
* If <75%: Supplier given 90 days to improve or removed from ASL
