### 5.8 Annual QMS Effectiveness Assessment

At year-end Management Review (December), conduct comprehensive assessment:

* Adequacy: Are QMS processes and procedures sufficient? (any gaps, missing procedures, or resource shortfalls?)
* Effectiveness: Are processes producing desired outputs efficiently? (cycle times, first-pass yields, resource utilization)

Based on assessment, decide:
* QMS is effective, continue as-is with minor adjustments
