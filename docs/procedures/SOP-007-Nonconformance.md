## 1. Purpose
To ensure that products which do not conform to requirements are identified, controlled, and prevented from unintended use or delivery.

## 2. Scope
Applies to raw materials, work-in-progress (WIP), and finished modular units.

## 3. Procedure

### 3.1 Identification
* Any employee who identifies a defect must flag it.
* **Visual Indicator**: Attach a **RED TAG** or mark the area with red tape/paint.
* **Documentation**: Initiate an **NCR Form** (FORM-NCR01).

### 3.2 Segregation
* If the item is movable (e.g., a window or pile of lumber), move it to the designated "Quarantine Area."
* If the item is fixed (e.g., a framed wall), the Red Tag serves as the quarantine indicator. Work on the affected area must STOP.

### 3.3 Disposition
The QA Manager or designated authority evaluates the nonconformance and selects a disposition:
1.  **Rework**: Fix the item to meet original requirements.
2.  **Scrap**: Discard the item and replace.
3.  **Use As Is (UAI)**: Accept the deviation (Requires Engineering/DOH Approval if structural/safety related).

### 3.4 Verification
* After Rework is complete, the QA Manager must re-inspect.
* If acceptable, the Red Tag is removed, and the NCR is closed.

## 4. Records
* NCR Log (Database or Sheet)
* FORM-NCR01
