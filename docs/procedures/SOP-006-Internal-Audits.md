* Additional auditors (if any): Trained by QA Manager, conducted at least 2 supervised audits before leading
* Auditors do not audit own work (independence maintained)

### 5.3 Audit Execution

#### 5.3.1 Opening Meeting
* Auditor meets with auditee(s) (5-10 minutes)
* Review audit scope, schedule, and methodology
* Confirm records available
* Answer auditee questions
* Emphasize audit is objective evaluation, not "gotcha" exercise

#### 5.3.2 Evidence Collection
Auditor collects evidence through:

**Document Review:**
* Procedures: Verify current revision in use (check Document Control Log)
* Records: Sample Module Travelers, Inspection Forms, NCRs, Training Matrix, Calibration Records, POs, etc.
  * Sample size: Typically 10-20% of records from audit period, minimum 3-5 samples
  * Select random samples plus any high-risk items (e.g., modules with NCRs, critical suppliers)

**Observation:**
* Walk production bays during active work
* Observe crew performing tasks per Work Instructions
* Verify measurement equipment calibrated (check labels)
* Confirm controlled documents available at point of use
* Observe 5S housekeeping, Red Tag usage, material storage

**Interviews:**
* Ask Bay Supervisors, Crew Leads, and workers open-ended questions:
  * "How do you know which Work Instruction to follow for this phase?"
  * "What do you do if you find a defect?"
  * "Where do you check if your tape measure is calibrated?"
  * "Can you show me the latest version of SOP-003?"
* Verify understanding and consistent application of procedures

#### 5.3.3 Finding Documentation
For each nonconformance or observation:
1. Record on Audit Checklist (FORM-AUD01)
2. Note specific evidence:
   * **Example Major Finding**: "Module SN-2025-042: HP-4 (MEP) pressure test recorded as 95 PSI end pressure (start 100 PSI), indicating 5 PSI drop. SOP-003 and ITP-P-02 require PASS criteria of max 2 PSI drop. HP-4 was signed off by QA Manager as 'Approved' despite failing test. Module currently in Phase 6."
   * **Example Minor Finding**: "Training Matrix shows employee John Doe completed Phase 1 training on 2025-05-10, but no test score documented. SOP-002 Section 5.3.3 requires competency evaluation with minimum 80% score."
   * **Example Observation**: "Material certifications for lumber are filed in binder by PO number, but no index or log to quickly locate certificates. Consider implementing Material Certification Log for improved traceability."
3. Classify finding: Major, Minor, or Observation
4. Reference procedure or requirement violated
5. Take photos if helpful (e.g., out-of-calibration equipment label, Red-tagged item)

#### 5.3.4 Closing Meeting
* Auditor meets with auditee(s) (15-30 minutes)
* Present findings:
  * Summarize areas of conformance (positive feedback)
  * Review each Major and Minor finding
  * Discuss Observations
* Auditee may provide clarification or additional evidence
  * If clarification resolves finding: Auditor may reclassify or withdraw finding
  * If unresolved: Finding stands, corrective action required
* Agree on timeline for corrective action response (typically 14 days for minor, 7 days for major)
* Thank auditee for cooperation

### 5.4 Audit Reporting

#### 5.4.1 Audit Report Preparation
QA Manager prepares Internal Audit Report (FORM-AUD02) within 5 business days of audit completion, including:

**Report Sections:**
1. **Audit Information**
   * Audit ID (AUD-YYYY-##)
   * Date(s) conducted
   * Auditor(s)
   * Auditee(s)
   * Scope (processes, procedures, record date range)

2. **Executive Summary**
   * Overall conformance assessment (Satisfactory / Needs Improvement / Unsatisfactory)
   * Number of findings (Major: X, Minor: Y, Observations: Z)
   * Key strengths observed
   * Key improvement areas

3. **Detailed Findings**
   * Each Major and Minor finding listed with:
     * Finding ID (AUD-YYYY-##-F01, F02, etc.)
     * Classification (Major/Minor)
     * Description (what was found, evidence)
     * Requirement violated (procedure section, regulation)
     * Impact/Risk
     * Required corrective action

4. **Observations** (Improvement Opportunities)

5. **Conformances** (Areas performing well)

6. **Conclusion and Follow-Up Actions**

#### 5.4.2 Report Distribution
* Auditee (Process Owner)
* President (Top Management)
* COO (if production-related audit)
* Filed in Internal Audit Records folder

### 5.5 Corrective Action and Follow-Up

#### 5.5.1 Corrective Action Response
* Auditee (Process Owner) responds to each Major and Minor finding within agreed timeline
* Response documented on Corrective Action Plan (FORM-AUD03 or linked to FORM-CAPA01 if CAPA initiated per SOP-008)
* Response includes:
  1. **Immediate Containment**: What was done immediately to address the specific nonconformance? (e.g., "Module SN-2025-042 re-inspected, pressure test repeated and passed at 100 PSI hold")
  2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Why did this happen? (e.g., "QA Manager misunderstood pass criteria, thought 5 PSI drop was acceptable")
  3. **Corrective Action**: What will prevent recurrence? (e.g., "QA Manager retrained on SOP-003 and ITP-P-02 pressure test criteria. Clarified that max 2 PSI drop is target, some jurisdictions allow up to 5 PSI but Fort Homes standard is 2 PSI. Updated ITP-P-02 to add note: 'Fort Homes internal standard: 2 PSI max drop for PASS'")
  4. **Verification**: How will effectiveness be confirmed? (e.g., "QA Manager to conduct next 3 HP-4 inspections under COO observation to verify correct application of criteria")
  5. **Target Completion Date**

#### 5.5.2 Follow-Up Audit
* QA Manager verifies corrective actions implemented and effective
* For Major Findings: Follow-up audit within 30 days
* For Minor Findings: Follow-up verification at next scheduled audit or within 90 days
* Follow-up methods:
  * Review updated records (e.g., verify next 3 HP-4 inspections show correct test criteria application)
  * Re-interview personnel (verify understanding)
  * Re-observe process (verify procedure being followed)
* If corrective action effective: Close finding
* If corrective action not effective: Escalate to CAPA (SOP-008), extend follow-up

### 5.6 Audit Program Evaluation

#### 5.6.1 Annual Audit Program Review
At year-end (December), QA Manager evaluates audit program effectiveness:
* Were all planned audits completed? (Target: 100%)
* Were findings addressed timely? (Target: 100% corrective actions completed within agreed timelines)
* Did findings lead to measurable improvements? (Review KPIs: NCR rates, Hold Point first-pass yield, etc.)
* Were any processes or procedures not audited in past 12 months? (Address in next year's schedule)
* Auditor competence adequate? (Consider additional training if needed)

#### 5.6.2 Management Review Input
QA Manager presents audit program summary at Management Review (SOP-009) including:
* Number of audits conducted vs. planned
* Total findings (Major, Minor, Observations) by process area
* Trends: Increasing/decreasing findings? Repeat findings?
* Areas of excellence
* Areas needing management attention or resource allocation

### 5.7 Special Audit Considerations

#### 5.7.1 External Audit Preparation
When Fort Homes expects external audit (DOH, IHIP, customer):
* QA Manager conducts pre-audit internal audit focusing on expected external audit scope
* Corrective actions expedited to close findings before external audit
* Records organized and accessible
* Personnel briefed on external audit process

#### 5.7.2 Supplier Audits
Per SOP-004, QA Manager may conduct audits of critical suppliers:
* Use supplier audit checklist (FORM-SUP04)
* Focus on quality system, material traceability, test/inspection capabilities
* Audit report shared with supplier, findings tracked similarly to internal audits
