## 2. Layout Selection: The Fort Homes Approach

### 2.1 Why This Layout?

**The layout selected is a "Visual-First Lean Manufacturing" approach:**

```
Traditional QMS                Fort Homes QMS
──────────────────────────────────────────────
Text-heavy manuals            Visual procedures
Thick compliance binders       Digital-first PDFs
Abstract descriptions         Step-by-step photos
Complex cross-references      Hyperlinked navigation
Hierarchical silos            Integrated workflows
```

### 2.2 Why Not Other Approaches?

| Approach | Pros | Cons | Fort Homes Decision |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pure ISO 9001** | Regulatory safe; widely recognized | Overly complex for production floor; text-heavy | ✗ Too formal |
| **Lean/Kanban Visual** | Excellent for production floor | Lacks compliance depth; poor audit trails | ✓ + Additional structure |
| **Traditional Construction** | Well-established standards | Dated; not optimized for digital/photo | ✗ Outdated |
| **Fort Homes Hybrid** | Best of all: visual, compliant, auditable, modern | Requires ongoing refinement | ✓✓ **SELECTED** |

### 3.3 Professional Formatting Standards

**Consistent across all documents:**

| Element | Standard |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Typography** | 11pt body (Calibri/Arial), 14-18pt headings |
| **Color** | Navy/Teal primary, Red warnings, Green approvals |
| **Layout** | Single-column, 15% white space minimum |
| **Hierarchies** | H1 (title) → H2 (section) → H3 (subsection) → Body |
| **Tables** | Black borders, bold headers, left-aligned text |
