QC Tools folder

Contains:
- `qc-tools-procurement.csv` — procurement spreadsheet with suggested models and quantities.
- `tools-overview.svg` — simple visual overview of tool categories for QC.

Next steps:
- I can convert the CSV to an Excel file and add suggested vendors/prices.
- I can embed the SVG into `docs/sops/SOP-104-MEP-Rough-In-Testing.md` if you want visuals inside the SOP.
