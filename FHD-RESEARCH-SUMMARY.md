## KEY DISCOVERIES FROM RESEARCH

### 1. Regulatory Landscape

**HUD Code is Comprehensive & Clear**
- All field installation work must comply with 24 CFR 3280 (Manufacturing Standards)
- On-site completion procedures defined in 24 CFR 3282.601-609 (Subpart M)
- Manufacturer retains responsibility for all on-site work quality
- IPIA (Independent Production Inspection Agency) required for final approval

**Colorado Context Favorable**
- State allows both HUD-certified modular AND IRC-compliant modular structures
- Colorado actively encourages modular construction for efficiency
- Clear regulatory path established by state authorities

### 2. FHD Field Operations Structure

**7 Installation Phases Identified & Mapped:**
```
FI-001: Site Preparation & Foundation (3-7 days)
FI-002: Module Transport & Delivery (1-2 days)
FI-003: Module Placement & Leveling (1-2 days)
FI-004: Module Connection & Sealing (2-3 days)
FI-005: Utility Final Connections (3-5 days)  ← Most Complex
FI-006: Site Finishing (2-5 days)
FI-007: Final Inspection & Customer Handoff (1 day)

Total Installation Timeline: 12-14 days target
```

**Critical Holdpoints Identified:**
- FI-001: Foundation certification, utility clearance
- FI-003: Leveling verification, pier inspection
- FI-005: Licensed trade certifications (electrician, plumber, gas technician)
- FI-007: IPIA final on-site inspection (mandatory before occupancy)

### 3. Advanced QMS Features

**Hybrid Factory-Field Integration:**
- Factory QMS maintains full responsibility for module quality
- Field QMS handles site-specific work and final assembly
- Shared procedures where applicable (document control, training, CAPA)
- Clear accountability boundaries between factory and field

**Cutting-Edge Elements to Implement:**
1. **Holdpoint Strategy** - Multiple inspection gates per installation
2. **Licensed Trade Coordination** - Certified professional oversight
3. **Technology Platform** - Mobile QMS app with real-time tracking
4. **IPIA Integration** - Seamless coordination with independent inspectors
5. **Metrics Dashboard** - KPI tracking for continuous improvement
6. **Customer Transparency** - Portal showing installation progress

### 4. Regulatory Compliance Path

**No Gray Areas - Clear Compliance Framework:**

| Component | Regulated By | FHD Responsibility |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Factory module quality | HUD Code 3280 | Fort and Homes LLC ✓ |
| On-site completion procedures | HUD Code 3282.601-609 | FHD must follow ✓ |
| Final IPIA inspection | HUD Code 3282.605 | FHD coordinates with IPIA ✓ |
| Licensed utility work | Local codes + HUD | FHD contracts certified trades ✓ |
| Documentation & records | HUD Code 3282.605, 3282.417 | FHD must maintain ✓ |
| Customer notification | HUD Code 3282.606-607 | FHD must provide ✓ |

## STRATEGIC DECISIONS MADE

### ✅ HYBRID APPROACH CONFIRMED (Option C)
**Decision:** Maintain separate repositories with clear integration points
- **Factory Repository:** `fort-homes-qms` - Unchanged (28 SOPs + 8 phases)
- **Field Repository:** `fort-homes-development-qms` (new) - 7 installation phases + 8 field QMS procedures
- **Shared Core:** Adaptation of 5-6 SOPs (document control, training, CAPA, etc.)

**Why This Works:**
- Maintains factory accountability for module quality
- Gives FHD autonomy for field operations
- Enables multi-site FHD expansion
- Simplifies regulatory compliance (separate IPIA oversight if needed)
- Allows independent evolution of procedures based on operational experience

### ✅ COMPREHENSIVE HOLDPOINT STRATEGY
**Decision:** Implement 3-tier holdpoint approach
1. **Critical Holdpoints** → IPIA inspection required (e.g., leveling, electrical testing, final inspection)
2. **Inspection Holdpoints** → FHD QA inspector required (e.g., sealing, connections, torque verification)
3. **Supervisory Holdpoints** → Field supervisor sign-off only (e.g., cleanup, material ordering)

**Benefit:** Balances rigorous quality with operational efficiency

### ✅ LICENSED TRADE INTEGRATION
**Decision:** FHD coordinates with, but doesn't replace, licensed professionals
- Electricians for final electrical connections
- Plumbers for water/sewer connections
- Gas technicians for gas connections
- FHD verifies certifications and coordinates schedules

**Regulatory Requirement:** HUD Code requires licensed work per local codes

### ✅ TECHNOLOGY-FIRST APPROACH
**Decision:** Implement mobile-first QMS platform from Day 1
- Field teams work on tablets/phones, not paper
- Real-time photo documentation with timestamps
- Digital holdpoint sign-offs
- Automatic IPIA notification for inspection scheduling
- Customer progress portal

**Competitive Advantage:** First-mover advantage in digital field operations
